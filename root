All characters in each identifier must be from a single script,\nor from any of the following combinations:\n\nLatin + Han + Hiragana + Katakana; or equivalently: Latn + Jpan\n\nLatin + Han + Bopomofo; or equivalently: Latn + Hanb\n\nLatin + Han + Hangul; or equivalently: Latn + Kore\n\nAllow Latin with other Recommended or Aspirational scripts except Cyrillic and Greek.\nhttp://www.unicode.org/reports/tr39/#Restriction_Level_Detection\n\nSome characters are not in modern customary use, and thus implementations may want to exclude them from identifiers. These include characters in historic and obsolete scripts, scripts used mostly liturgically, and regional scripts used only in very small communities or with very limited current usage. The set of characters in Table 4, Candidate Characters for Exclusion from Identifiers provides candidates of these, plus some inappropriate technical blocks.\n\nhttp://www.unicode.org/reports/tr31/#Table_Candidate_Characters_for_Exclusion_from_Identifiers","files":null}]}
