=head1 NAME

perlcdelta - what is new for cperl v5.27.2

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes the differences between the cperl 5.27.1
and the cperl 5.27.2 releases.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as v5.24.2c, first
read the L<perl526*cdelta> documentation, which describes differences
between v5.26.0c and v5.26.2c

=head1 Core Enhancements

=head2 Optimize static methods to subs

When a method call can be proven at compile-time to use a specific
subroutine, optimize away the run-time method dispatch on a non-threaded perl.
When it is for a XS subroutine, such as with e.g. C<use strict;> which does
C<< BEGIN {require strict;} strict->import; >> the C<< strict->import >>
part is optimized from the slow C<entersub> op to the C<enterxssub> op,
as if via C<strict::import("strict",...)>.
The slow GV lookup in entersub cannot be converted to a faster CVref lookup,
as this would break dynamic method redefinitions.
See L<http://blogs.perl.org/users/rurban/2011/06/how-perl-calls-subs-and-methods.html>.
This is ~4% faster for each such method call.
cperl-only.

=head2 Dump more COP fields

Dump the values of a COP C<$^H>, C<%^H> and the lexical warnings via
C<op_dump()> and it's XS module L<Devel::Peek>.
Improve the display of cop SEQ values and ranges, and padnames.
Added a DEBUGGING C<cop_dump()> helper, esp. useful for deleted C<PL_curcop>'s.
cperl-only.

=head2 More unicode ops

Added the strong unicode fraction op C</> U+2044, which binds stronger
than all other arithmetic ops, and the two unicode multiplication ops
C<⋅> U+022C5 (dot operator) and C<∙> U+2219 (multiplication dot),
which binds the same as C<*>.
cperl-only.

=head2 L<delete|perlfunc/delete EXPR> on key/value slices

L<delete|perlfunc/delete EXPR> can now be used on key/value slices,
returning the keys along with the deleted values.
L<[perl #131328]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=131328>

=head2 Unicode 10.0 is supported

A list of changes is at
L<http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode10.0.0>.

=head2 Re-enable warnings illegalproto

Parse prototypes for errors again. Either with C<:prototype()> or as
signature.  Illegal prototypes are not stored. Most illegal protos are
subsequently parsed as signature, but some are just wrong protos, such
as C<'[$'> missing the C<']'>, or C<:prototype($_$)>.

=head2 In-place editing is now safer

Previously in-place editing would delete or rename the input file
as soon as you started working on a new file.

Without backups this would result in loss of data if there was an
error, such as a full disk, when writing to the output file.

This has changed so that the input file isn't replaced until the
output file has been completely written and successfully closed.

This works by creating a work file in the same directory, which is
renamed over the input file once the output file is complete.

Incompatibilities:

=over

=item *

Since this renaming needs to only happen once, if you create a thread
or child process, that renaming will only happen in the original
thread or process.

=item *

If you change directories while processing a file, and your operating
system doesn't provide the C<unlinkat()>, C<renameat()> and C<fchmodat()>
functions, the final rename step may fail.

=back

L<[perl #127663]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=127663>


=head2 Initialisation of aggregate state variables

A persistent lexical array or hash variable can now be initialized,
by an expression such as C<state @a = qw(x y z)>.  Initialization of a
list of persistent lexical variables is still not possible.

=head2 Full-size inode numbers

On platforms where inode numbers are of a type larger than perl's native
integer numerical types, L<stat|perlfunc/stat> will preserve the full
content of large inode numbers by returning them in the form of strings of
decimal digits.  Exact comparison of inode numbers can thus be achieved by
comparing with C<eq> rather than C<==>.  Comparison with C<==>, and other
numerical operations (which are usually meaningless on inode numbers),
work as well as they did before, which is to say they fall back to
floating point, and ultimately operate on a fairly useless rounded inode
number if the real inode number is too big for the floating point format.

=head2 Changed warnings::register handling of all

If a scope used "use warnings 'all'" to turn on all warnings and then
turned off some specific warnings, then that scope wouldn't get
warnings for subsequently-registered warning categories, because
its bitset doesn't extend to the bit controlling the new category.

Unlike all other warning categories, the bits for "all" used to be set
only when there were no warning categories disabled; disabling any
would also clear the "all" bits.  That was supporting the dynamic
nature of warnings::register extending the all-warnings bitset for
new categories.  This exception is now removed, so the meaning of the
"all" bits is now the more obvious meaning, of indicating the default
treatment that the scope wants for warnings not falling into any
category known to the bitset.  In C<warnings::warnif()> et al, if the
caller's bitset is found to be too short to have a bit for the
relevant category, then the setting for the "all" category is used
instead.

Because the length of a bitset is an integral number of bytes, but
only two bits are used per category, the length of a bitset doesn't
precisely indicate which categories had been registered by the time it
was constructed.  So the standard bitsets for the "all" category are
now always filled to their byte length, with bits set preemptively for
categories not yet registered that fall within the current bitset length.

When a warnings pragma operates on a bitset, it first expands it to the
preferred length, by duplicating the "all" bits for the categories covered
by the new length.  It is careful to maintain the length when combining
the bitset with the standard bitsets for categories.  When a bitset is
read from C<${^WARNING_BITS}> or from C<caller()>, the standard C<pWARN_ALL>
setting is no longer expanded by the core to C<$warnings::Bits{all}>,
because the core's short C<WARN_ALLstring> will now be expanded correctly
just like any other bitset.

message could either contain the contents of a random, possibly large, chunk of
memory, or could crash perl.  This has now been fixed.

A possible stack buffer overflow in the C<%ENV> code on Windows has been fixed
by removing the buffer completely since it was superfluous anyway.
L<[perl #131665]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131665>

=head2 Unsigned long stack access of printf format arguments

perl 5.27.5 started allowing unsigned long/4 stack indices for its sv
arguments, and width and precision with the API even allowing
C<unsigned long>.  Previously those numbers were safely typed to
C<int>. Revert that security problem in cperl. The maximal width and
precision is also back to INT_MAX.  See L<[cperl
#344]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/344>

=head1 Incompatible Changes

=head2 Comma-less variable lists in formats are no longer allowed

Omitting the commas between variables passed to formats is no longer
allowed.  This has been deprecated since perl 5.000.

=head2 The C<:locked> and C<:unique> attributes have been removed

These have been no-ops and deprecated since perl 5.12 and 5.10,
respectively.

=head2 C<\N{}> with nothing between the braces is now illegal.

This has been deprecated since Perl 5.24.

=head2 Opening the same symbol as both a file and directory handle is no longer allowed

Using L<open()|perlfunc/open FILEHANDLE,EXPR> and
L<opendir()|perlfunc/opendir DIRHANDLE,EXPR> to associate both a
filehandle and a dirhandle to the same symbol (glob or scalar) has
been deprecated since Perl 5.10.

=head2 Use of bare C<< << >> to mean C<< <<"" >> is no longer allowed

Use of a bare terminator has been deprecated since Perl 5.000.

=head2 Setting $/ to a reference to a non-positive integer no longer allowed

This used to work like setting it to C<undef>, but has been deprecated
since Perl 5.20.

=head2 Unicode code points with values exceeding C<IV_MAX> are now fatal.

This was deprecated since Perl 5.24.

=head2 C<B::OP::terse> no longer exists.

Use C<B::Concise::b_terse> instead.

=head2 Use of inherited AUTOLOAD for non-methods is no longer allowed.

This was deprecated in Perl 5.004.

=head2 Use of strings with code points over 0xFF is not allowed for
bitwise string operators

Code points over 0xFF do not make sense for bitwise operators.

=head2 Backslash no longer escapes colon in PATH for the -S switch

Previously the C<-S> switch incorrectly treated backslash ("\") as an
escape for colon when traversing the C<PATH> environment variable.
L<[perl #129183]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=129183>

=head2 Subroutines no longer need typeglobs

Perl 5.22.0 introduced an optimization allowing subroutines to be stored in
packages as simple sub refs, not requiring a full typeglob (thus
potentially saving large amounts of memeory).  However, the optimization
was flawed: it only applied to the main package.

This optimization has now been extended to all packages.  This may break
compatibility with introspection code that looks inside stashes and expects
everything in them to be a typeglob.

When this optimization happens, the typeglob still notionally exists, so
accessing it will cause the stash entry to be upgraded to a typeglob.  The
optimization does not apply to XSUBs or exported subroutines, and calling a
method will undo it, since method calls cache things in typeglobs.

=head2 ... is a term in cperl, not a statement

perl5.27.6 restricted C<...>, the yada-yada operator, to be a
statement only.  cperl reserved C<...> for the ellipsis,
i.e. unassigned varargs in signatures to be passed through. Which is
not a statement, but a term.  In cperl C<...> is a TERM. Before C<...>
was parsed as an operator, also used for ranges.

This affects illegal code like:

    ... . "foo";
    ... if $a < $b;
    do{...}

=head1 Deprecations

=head2 Use of L<$1>|perlfunc/vec EXPR,OFFSET,BITS> on strings with code
points above 0xFF is deprecated.

Use of these is nonsensical, as C<vec> is a bit-oriented operation,
which operates on the underlying UTF-8 representation these strings must
be in, and will likely give unexpected results.

=head2 Some uses of unescaped C<"{"> are no longer fatal

Perl 5.26.0 fatalized some uses of an unescaped left brace, but an
exception was made at the last minute, specifically crafted to be a
minimal change to allow GNU Autoconf to work.  This code is heavily
depended upon, and continues to use the deprecated usage.  Its use of an
unescaped left brace is one where we have no intention of repurposing
C<"{"> to be something other than itself.

That exception is now generalized to include various other such cases
where the C<"{"> will not be repurposed.  This is to get real experience
with this more complicated change now, in case we need to issue a dot
release if we find other things like Autoconf that are important to work
around.

Note that these uses continue to raise a deprecation message.

=head2 Module removals

XXX Remove this section if inapplicable.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<"deprecated">-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

L<[perl #129990]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=129990>

=item *

Calls to C<require> for an already loaded module are now slightly faster.
L<[perl #132171]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=132171>

=item *

Many string concatenation expressions are now considerably faster, due
to the introduction internally of a C<multiconcat> opcode which combines
multiple concatenations, and optionally a C<=> or C<.=>, into a single
action. For example, apart from retrieving C<$s>, C<$a> and C<$b>, this
whole expression is now handled as a single op:

    $s .= "a=$a b=$b\n"

As a special case, if the LHS of an assign is a lexical variable or
C<my $s>, the op itself handles retrieving the lexical variable, which
is faster.

In general, the more the expression includes a mix of constant strings and
variable expressions, the longer the expression, and the more it mixes
together non-utf8 and utf8 strings, the more marked the performance
improvement. For example on a C<x86_64> system, this code has been
benchmarked running four times faster:

    my $s;
    my $a = "ab\x{100}cde";
    my $b = "fghij";
    my $c = "\x{101}klmn";

    for my $i (1..10_000_000) {
        $s = "\x{100}wxyz";
        $s .= "foo=$a bar=$b baz=$c";
    }

In addition, C<sprintf> expressions which have a constant format
containing only C<%s> and C<%%> format elements, and which have a fixed
number of arguments, are now also optimised into a C<multiconcat> op.

=item *

Subroutines in packages no longer need to be stored in typeglobs, saving
large amounts of memory.  See L</Subroutines no longer need typeglobs>

the role method would be different to a field index in the resulting
class, the method is not yet fixed up to the new indices. A
temp. solution would be to change the ordering of the roles, or to use
the C<< $self->field >> method syntax in the role method.  This should
be fixed before 5.28. Currently we can only alias composed role
methods and we don't change the ordering of the fields.

=head1 Configuration and Compilation

=over 4

=item C89 requirement

Perl has been documented as requiring a C89 compiler to build since October
1998.  A variety of simplifications have now been made to Perl's internals to
rely on the features specified by the C89 standard. We believe that this
internal change hasn't altered the set of platforms that Perl builds on, but
please report a bug if Perl now has new problems building on your platform.

=item -Werror=pointer-arith

With GCC, C<-Werror=pointer-arith> is now enabled by default,
disallowing arithmetic on void and function pointers.

=item d_builtin_arith_overflow

Fixed C<d_builtin_arith_overflow> detection and usage for 32bit
systems with C<use64bitint>. They do use the C<ll> suffix, same as with
WIN64.  Now we can use this optimization.
cperl-only.

=item New probes

Note that cperl ignores the new C<HAS_BUILTIN_{ADD,MUL,SUB}_OVERFLOW>
config keys as we use the better C<HAS_BUILTIN_ARITH_OVERFLOW> for
years already.

=item *

Added L<perlapi/hv_undef_flags> to the public API.

=item *

Refactored the L<fields> API from global data into methods.
Added a L<perlapi/HvFIELDS> field to HvAUX as linear buffer
of "name\0pad...\0" fields, no class C<%FIELDS> and C<@FIELDS> anymore.
See L<[cperl #322]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/322>

=item *

L<perlintern/validate_proto> got an additional cperl-only bool
argument C<maybe_sig>.

=item *

A new function, L<Perl_langinfo()|perlapi/Perl_langinfo> has been
added.  It is an (almost) drop-in replacement for the system
C<nl_langinfo(3)>, but works on platforms that lack that; as well as
being more thread-safe, and hiding some gotchas with locale handling
from the caller.  Code that uses this, needn't use L<localeconv(3)>
(and be affected by the gotchas) to find the decimal point, thousands
separator, or currency symbol.  See L<perlapi/Perl_langinfo>.

=item *

A new API function L<sv_rvunweaken()|perlapi/sv_rvunweaken> has
been added to complement L<sv_rvweaken()|perlapi/sv_rvweaken>.
The implementation was taken from L<Scalar::Util/unweaken>.

=item *

A new flag, C<SORTf_UNSTABLE>, has been added. This will allow a
future commit to make mergesort unstable when the user specifies ‘no
sort stable’, since it has been decided that mergesort should remain
stable by default.

=item *

A new optimisation phase has been added to the compiler,
C<optimize_optree()>, which does a top-down scan of a complete optree
just before the peephole optimiser is run. This phase is not currently
hookable.
This phase was previously in cperl named C<prefinalize_op> and
C<postprocess_optree>.

=item *

An C<OP_MULTICONCAT> op has been added. At C<optimize_optree()> time, a
chain of C<OP_CONCAT> and C<OP_CONST> ops, together optionally with an
C<OP_STRINGIFY> and/or C<OP_SASSIGN>, are combined into a single
C<OP_MULTICONCAT> op. The op is of type C<UNOP_AUX>, and the aux array
contains the argument count, plus a pointer to a constant string and a set
of segment lengths. For example with

    my $x = "foo=$foo, bar=$bar\n";

the constant string would be C<"foo=, bar=\n"> and the segment lengths
would be (4,6,1). If the string contains characters such as C<\x80>, whose
representation changes under utf8, two sets of strings plus lengths are
precomputed and stored.

=item *

Direct access to L<PL_keyword_plugin|perlapi/PL_keyword_plugin> is not
safe in the presence of multithreading. A new
L<wrap_keyword_plugin|perlapi/wrap_keyword_plugin> function has been
added to allow XS modules to safely define custom keywords even when
loaded from a thread, analogous to L<PL_check|perlapi/PL_check> /
L<wrap_op_checker|perlapi/wrap_op_checker>.

The tokenizer no longer consumes the exponent part of a floating
point number if it's incomplete.
L<[perl #131725]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=131725>

=item *

On non-threaded builds, for C<m/$null/> where C<$null> is an empty
string is no longer treated as if the C</o> flag was present when the
previous matching match operator included the C</o> flag.  The
rewriting used to implement this behavior could confuse the
interpreter.  This matches the behaviour of threaded builds.
L<[perl #124368]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=124368>

=item *

The tokenizer now correctly adjusts a parse pointer when skipping
whitespace in a C< ${identifier} > construct.

=item *

The C<Copy()>, C<Move()>, C<Zero()> macros and their variants now
assert if the pointers supplied are C<NULL>.  ISO C considers
supplying NULL pointers to the functions these macros are built upon
as undefined behaviour even when their count parameters are zero.
Based on these assertions and the original bug report three macro
calls were made conditional.

Creating a thread with no parameters no longer tries to C<Copy()> a
null pointer. This fixes an assertion failure and allows threaded
builds to work again.

=item *

The C<je_old_stack_hwm> field, previously only found in the C<jmpenv>
structure on debugging builds, has been added to non-debug builds as
well. This fixes an issue with some CPAN modules caused by the size of
this structure varying between debugging and non-debugging builds.

=item *

Calling L<exec PROGRAM LIST|perlfunc/exec PROGRAM LIST> with an empty C<LIST>
has been fixed.  This should call C<execvp()> with an empty C<argv> array
(containing only the terminating C<NULL> pointer), but was instead just
returning false (and not setting L<$!|perlvar/$!>).
L<[perl #131730]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131730>

=item *

The C<gv_fetchmeth_sv> C function stopped working properly in Perl 5.22 when
fetching a constant with a UTF-8 name if that constant subroutine was stored in
the stash as a simple scalar reference, rather than a full typeglob.  This has
been fixed.

=item *

Single-letter debugger commands followed by an argument which starts with
punctuation  (e.g. C<p$^V> and C<x@ARGV>) now work again.  They had been
wrongly requiring a space between the command and the argument.
L<[perl #120174]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=120174>

=item *

L<splice|perlfunc/splice ARRAY,OFFSET,LENGTH,LIST> now throws an exception
("Modification of a read-only value attempted") when modifying a read-only
array.  Until now it had been silently modifying the array.  The new behaviour
is consistent with the behaviour of L<push|perlfunc/push ARRAY,LIST> and
L<unshift|perlfunc/unshift ARRAY,LIST>.
L<[perl #131000]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131000>

=item *

C<stat()>, C<lstat()>, and file test operators now fail if given a
filename containing a nul character, in the same way that C<open()>
already fails.

=item *

C<stat()>, C<lstat()>, and file test operators now reliably set C<$!> when
failing due to being applied to a closed or otherwise invalid file handle.

=item *

File test operators for Unix permission bits that don't exist on a
particular platform, such as C<-k> (sticky bit) on Windows, now check that
the file being tested exists before returning the blanket false result,
and yield the appropriate errors if the argument doesn't refer to a file.

=item *

The in-place reverse optimisation now correctly strengthens weak
references using the L<sv_rvunweaken()|perlapi/sv_rvunweaken>
API function.

at the beginning of the character set for the transliteration
operator.
