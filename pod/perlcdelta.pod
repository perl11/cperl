=head1 NAME

perlcdelta - what is new for cperl v5.29.2

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the cperl 5.29.2 and the cperl
5.29.1 release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as v5.29.0c, first read
L<perl5291cdelta>, which describes differences between v5.29.0c and v5.29.1c.

=head1 Core Enhancements

=head2 Unicode 11.0 is supported

For details, see L<https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode11.0.0/>.

The Word_Break property, as in past Perl releases, remains tailored to
behave more in line with expectations of Perl users.  This means that
sequential runs of horizontal white space characters are not broken
apart, but kept as a single run.  Unicode 11 changed from past versions
to be more in line with Perl, but it left several white space characters
as causing breaks: TAB, NO BREAK SPACE, and FIGURE SPACE (U+2007).  We
have decided to continue to use the previous Perl tailoring with regards
to these.

As of July 2018, another aspect of Unicode 11.0 is causing problems, and
that is the changing the Georgian script to have both lower and
uppercase letters.  It turns out that many devices do not have fonts
installed that can display the new uppercase letters, and people using
Georgian are finding their text more or less illegible.  It is being
suggested that implementations delay their adoption of this portion of
11.0.

But since the next stable release of Perl is almost a year away, this
aspect of 11.0 is being left in, with the option to back it out if
things haven't improved by that time, or if we get too many complaints
about the development release being unusable for Georgian users.

=head2 Handle qr!\p{nv=6/8}!

Allow a rational number specified in looking up the Numeric
Value Unicode property to not be in lowest possible terms.

The Numeric Value property allows one to find all code points that have
a certain numeric value.  An example would be to match against any
character in any of the world's scripts which is effectively equivalent
to the digit zero.

We accept either integers (like C<\p{nv=9}>) or rationals (like C<\p{nv=1/2}>).
But we also accept floating point representations in case a conversion to numeric
has happened, (like C<\p{nv=0.5}>).
The necessary precision is now automatically pre-calculated and the lookup
normalized.

=head2 The maximum number of times a pattern can match has been doubled
to 65535

This means if you specify C<qr/a+/> that there can be anywhere from 1
through 65535 C<"a">'s in a row, instead of 32267 as previously.

The upper limit C<"n"> specifiable in a regular expression
quantifier of the form C<"{m,n}"> has also been doubled to 65534.

The meaning of an unbounded upper quantifier C<"{m,}"> remains unchanged.
It matches 2**31 - 1 times on most platforms, and more on ones where a C
language short variable is more than 4 bytes long.

=head2 C<-Drv> now means something on C<-DDEBUGGING> builds

Now, adding the verbose flag (C<-Dv>) to the C<-Dr> flag turns on all
possible regular expression debugging, as with C<use re 'debug';>. See L<re>.

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

=head2 Assigning non-zero to C<$[> is fatal

Setting L<< C<$[>|perlvar/$[ >> to a non-zero value has been deprecated since
Perl 5.12 and now throws a fatal error.
See L<<< perldeprecation/Assigning non-zero to C<< $[ >> is fatal >>>.

=head2 Previously deprecated sysread()/syswrite() on :utf8 handles now fatal

Calling sysread(), syswrite(), send() or recv() on a C<:utf8> handle,
whether applied explicitly or implicitly, is now fatal.  This was
deprecated in perl 5.24.

There were two problems with calling these functions on C<:utf8>
handles:

=over

=item *

All four functions only paid attention to the C<:utf8> flag.  Other
layers were completely ignored, so a handle with
C<:encoding(UTF-16LE)> layer would be treated as UTF-8.  Other layers,
such as compression are completely ignored with or without the
C<:utf8> flag.

=item *

sysread() and recv() would read from the handle, skipping any
validation by the layers, and do no validation of their own.  This
could lead to invalidly encoded perl scalars.

=back

L<[perl #125760]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=125760>

=head2 my() in false conditional prohibited

Declarations such as C<my $x if 0> are no longer permitted.
This feature was deprecated in 5.10 (and replaced by two better constructs,
one of it backwards compatible) and is now a fatal error.
L<[perl #133543]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=133543>

Note: cperl does not agree that this feature is a bug, but this ship
sailed already over a decade ago.

=head2 Fatalize $* and $#

These special variables, long deprecated, now throw an error when used.
See L<perldiag/"$* is no longer supported as of Perl 5.30"> and
L<perldiag/"$# is no longer supported as of Perl 5.30">.
L<[perl #133583]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=133583>

=head2 Fatalize unqualified use of dump()

The C<dump()> function, long discouraged, may no longer be used unless it is
fully qualified, I<i.e.>, C<CORE::dump()>.

L<[perl #133584]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=133584>

=head2 Remove File::Glob::glob()

The C<File::Glob::glob()> function, long deprecated, has been removed and now
throws an exception which advises use of C<File::Glob::bsd_glob()> instead.

L<[perl #133586]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=133586>

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.

=head2 Module removals

XXX Remove this section if inapplicable.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<"deprecated">-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

=over

=item XXX

XXX Note that deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are listed
as an updated module in the L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

=back

=head2 Remove support for C<qr/\p{_Case_Ignorable}>

This property is no longer used in the core, nor in cpan, and is marked
as for core use only, not necessarily stable.  I have kept it around
because it was work to remove it, but now the revamping of the property
lookup scheme was causing failures with it, when compiling on early
Unicode releases.  That could be fixed with extra work, but simply
removing it also fixes the problem and avoids future maintenance
costs.

=head2 Remove support for C<qr/\p{_Comb_Above}>

This property is no longer used in the core, nor in cpan, and is marked
as for core use only, not necessarily stable.  I have kept it around
because it was work to remove it, but now the revamping of the property
lookup scheme was causing failures with a similar property, and the
previous commit removed that one.

=head2 Remove support for C<qr/\p{_CanonDCIJ}>

The property is not used in cpan, and is being removed as part of the cleanup
instigated because another of the 3 would
require extra code to handle if we were to keep it around.

=head1 Performance Enhancements

=over 4

=item *

Improved Unicode numeric property lookups, for C<\p{nv=float}>,
in size and speed by using more pre-compiled perfect hashes instead
of slow pure-perl invlist walks at run-time, esp. for all numeric
properties (70 more).
Also avoids more swash creations.

=item *

Translating from UTF-8 into the code point it represents now is done via a
deterministic finite automaton, speeding it up.  As a typical example,
C<ord("\x7fff")> now requires 12% fewer instructions than before.  The
performance of checking that a sequence of bytes is valid UTF-8 is similarly
improved, again by using a dfa.

=back

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>.  A paragraph summary
for important changes should then be added by hand.  In an ideal world,
dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be cribbed.

The list of new and updated modules is modified automatically as part of
preparing a Perl release, so the only reason to manually add entries here is if
you're summarising the important changes in the module update. (Also, if the
manually-added details don't match the automatically-generated ones, the
release manager will have to investigate the situation carefully.)

We also removed the remaining exception for files starting with 0.
We assumed before that the reason a test file's name begins with a 0 is to
order its execution among the tests in its directory.  Hence, a
directory containing such files should be tested in serial order.
But in reality there's no such F<t/00-setup.t> test and if so, it would still
be run as very first test. CPAN testing via EUMM and Test::Harness does
not obey this rule neither.

=item Mac OS X

Perl's build and testing process on Mac OS X for C<-Duseshrplib>

(B<SIP>).

SIP prevents binaries in F</bin> (and a few other places) being passed
the C<DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH> environment variable.  For our purposes this
prevents C<DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH> from being passed to the shell, which
prevents that variable being passed to the testing or build process,
so running C<perl> couldn't find F<libcperl.dylib>.

To workaround that, the initial build of the F<perl> executable
expects to find F<libcperl.dylib> in the build directory, and the
library path is then adjusted during installation to point to the
installed library.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at L<https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<cperlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If you think it's a cperl specific bug or trust the cperl developers more 
please file an issue at L<https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues>.
