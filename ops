I think https://github.com/Perl-Toolchain-Gang/toolchain-site/blob/master/lancaster-consensus.md#rules-for-distribution-naming PAUSE changes requires that the distro name be a package inside it now. That would stop someone from renaming a CPython tarball to perl. `XS-Config` or `XSConfig` are the 2 choices right now. If P5P ever dual-lifes this module (this could take weeks/months/a decade), then the tarball can be renamed to `Config-6.92.tar.gz` and published as that by P5P with their existing commit bits/rjbs's PAUSE ID.\n\n2nd message noted, I'll make rurban comaint as backup if I am bussed, I'll try to keep cpantesters happy.\n\n3rd `perl11/p5-Config` sounds good, perl11 has other non P5 langs floating around, so `Config` is too generic, I'd personally call it `perl11/XSConfig` since XS is the brand name of `native code` for P5 and no other lang. I kindda want to leave \"Config\" space alone incase P5P wants to dual life their PP Config.pm (`sub bincompat_options` and `sub non_bincompat_options` are new-ish in the history of config_heavy.pl). I also have an unpublished module called `VCConfig.pm` that does something with Visual C. So XSConfig as a name for the distro is seems reasonable (there will never be a `XSConfig.pm` disk file).\n\n4th. Everything will start at 6.00 and tick upwards at 0.01, version 6.00 happens to be inside cperl master's `Config_xs.PL` already.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"04135dc995e2fdcd322aaf4268dbf04630a3cc7c"},"timestamp":1450603702,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NjA5NjUxOQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/93#issuecomment-166096519"},"message":"ad 1st: You can name to distro as you want.
