(which we can due to our arena).\nSee also GH #189 \n\nAlso several other minor asan issues:\n- use-after-free in Dynaloader (ReadKey probe with -DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALAR)\n- heap-overflow in gv_fetchfile (t/comp/parser.t)\n- signature: gmpb -Dkv -e'sub t151($a,$b=do{my $foo;1},$c=1){} t151($x,$x,$x);'\n- heap-buffer-overflow in XSLoader\n- invalid memEQc in toke.c\n- B-C global-buffer-overflow with dynamic COW strings (27,28,43,44,45,49), wrong savepvn args","files":null}]}
