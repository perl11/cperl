=head1 NAME

perlcdelta - what is new for cperl v5.22.4

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes perl-only differences between the cperl 5.22.3
release and the cperl 5.22.4 release.

For B<cperl> also see F<Changes> and L<perlcperl>

=head1 Security

=head2 DynaLoader format string hardening

Replace all C<%> characters in user-controlled library filenames, passed via
the system dl_error call verbatim to C<printf>, without any arguments on the stack,
which could lead to execution of arbitrary stack code. No CVE.
This affects all systems with dynamic loading where the attacker can cause a
dynamic loading error.

CVSSv2 Severity: 7.2 (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:U/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:MH/TD:H/CR:H/IR:H/AR:ND)

=head2 No Unicode confusables +UFFA0, +U3164

In deviation from Unicode 1.1 we treat the two HANGUL FILLER characters +UFFA0 and +U3164
not as valid ID_Start and ID_Continue characters for perl identifiers.
Variable and package names may not begin with them and may not contain them.

They are usually rendered as whitespace, and would lead to classic TR39 confusables.
See L<https://github.com/jagracey/Awesome-Unicode#user-content-variable-identifiers-can-effectively-include-whitespace> and L<http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr39/>.

In a more Korean friendly environment, we could check for a ID_Start Hangul
filler if the next character is a valid Hangul ID_Continue character,
and allow it then.  Ditto for a ID_Continue Hangul filler if the
previous and next character is a valid Hangul ID_Start or ID_Continue
character, and allow it then.
But those fillers should be treated as whitespace, and should be ignored.

L<http://www.unicode.org/L2/L2006/06310-hangul-decompose9.pdf> explains:

I<< The two other hangul fillers HANGUL CHOSEONG FILLER (Lf),
i.e. lead filler, and HANGUL JUNGSEONG FILLER (Vf) are used as
placeholders for missing letters, where there should be at least one
letter. >>

I<< ... that leaves the (HALFWIDTH) HANGUL FILLERs useless. Indeed,
they should not be rendered at all, despite that they have been given
the property Lo. Note that these FILLERs are also given the property
of Default_Ignorable_Codepoint. >>

I<< Note that the standard normal forms NFKD and NFKC ... return (in
all views) incorrect results for strings containing these
characters. >>

=head1 Acknowledgements

cperl 5.22.4 represents approximately 1 week of development since cperl 5.22.3
and contains approximately 1,300 lines of changes across 55 files from 1
author.

Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there were
approximately 86 lines of changes to 12 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.

The following people are known to have contributed the improvements
that became cperl 5.22.4:

Reini Urban.

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated
from version control history. In particular, it does not include the names of
the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl bug
tracker.

Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules
included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for
helping Perl to flourish.

For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please see
the F<AUTHORS> file in the Perl source distribution.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
https://rt.perl.org/ .  There may also be information at
http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the F<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If you think it's a cperl specific bug or trust the cperl developers more 
please file an issue at L<https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues>.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
to perl5-security-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be
able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
CPAN.

If you trust the cperl developers more, please send an email to
them. The p5p security teams skips many security issues, or are
unwilling to fix them.
