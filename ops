But if I smoke p5p blead perl on appveyor, https://ci.appveyor.com/project/rurban/cperl/build/5.22.2.698/job/r943rf1768lupegy these 2 failures dont appear, that means it was fixed on p5p blead at some point, not sure if it is p5p code that fixed it, or it was fixed on cpan and cperl has an older dual life in it.\n\nI suspect ../cpan/Time-Piece/t/02core_dst.t was fixed (or silenced) by\n\nhttps://github.com/rjbs/Time-Piece/commit/ed25e7dd0633604886da254494f1e8a1c29ea375\n\n../dist/threads-shared/t/waithires.t I have no clue what is failing inside that .t because the appveyor logs aren't verbose.","files":null}]}
