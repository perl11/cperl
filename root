Keyword::Declare has a proper feature set, but horrible PPI based implementation.\n- Term::ReadKey, Term::ReadLine::Gnu for the debugger\n\nIdeally there should also be an IDE, but the vim, emacs, sublime, ... plugins are already properly packaged as such.\n\nFurthermore update ExtUtils::Constant to my fixed version, and move it from cpan to dist.\ncpan maintenance stalled.
