=item *

Fixed a cperl-only failure in signatures with default blocks introducing
a new lexical variable. As in C<sub t151($a,$b=do{my $f},$c=1){} t151($x,$x,$x)>.
This failure was only fatal on 32bit + -Duse64bitint systems.

C<SIGNATURE_arg_default_op> does not have a items arg.
See L<[cperl #164]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/164>.
and L<[cperl #213]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/213>.

=head1 Known Problems

For open cperl problems see L<[issues]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/>.

Some of these fixes also can to be backported from perl5.25.x upstream.

=item *

The perl debugger doesn't yet work with signatures. It doesn't step into
such functions and it may fail.
See e.g. L<[cperl #167]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/167>

=item *

F<t/op/taint.t> contained a test with signatures and 6 default
arguments, which on some 32 bit systems led to random "Reference
parameter cannot take default value at op/taint.t line 2461"
compile-time failures. This test has been rewritten to ony use 4 arguments.

See L<[cperl #164]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/164>

C<clang -flto=thin> and on some systems even C<gcc -flto> with C<-O3>
or C<-finline> leads to invisible symbols which were inlined and not
exported, even if they should be declared as public API. Work is
ongoing in the F<feature/gh186-lto-thin> branch, but there the
inlining is disabled by the C<used> attribute, leading to a
10% performance regression.  On the other hand a working
C<clang-3.9 -flto> leads to 20% performance improvements.

=item *

C< until ($x = 1) { ... } > and C< ... until $x = 1 > should
warn when syntax warnings are enabled.

=item *

C< ${\vec %h, 0, 1} > and C< ${\substr %h, 0} > should not segfault, rather
the lvalue context should be propagated, and list context properly handled.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
L<https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<cperlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If you think it's a cperl specific bug or trust the cperl developers more 
please file an issue at L<https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues>.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
For details of how to report the issue.
