Ditto for a ID_Continue Hangul filler if the\nprevious and next character is a valid Hangul ID_Start or ID_Continue character, and allow it then.\nBut those fillers should be treated as whitespace, and should be ignored.\nAnd all valid word checks need to be changed then and are much slower, as we only consider single chars as valid ID_Start or ID_Continue.\n\nhttp://www.unicode.org/L2/L2006/06310-hangul-decompose9.pdf explains:\n\n_The two other hangul fillers HANGUL CHOSEONG FILLER (Lf), i.e. lead filler, and HANGUL JUNGSEONG FILLER (Vf) are used as placeholders for missing letters, where there should be at least one letter._\n\n_... that leaves the (HALFWIDTH) HANGUL FILLERs useless. Indeed, they should not be rendered at all, despite that they have been given the property Lo. Note that these FILLERs are also given the property of Default_Ignorable_Codepoint._\n\n_Note that the standard normal forms NFKD and NFKC ... return (in all views) incorrect results for strings containing these characters._","files":null}]}
