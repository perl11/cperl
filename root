So far 7 with 64bit.\nSimilar as Mike Pall's lua patch or my p2 variant, just easier, as we already have a free sv_any ptr to the string. \nAnd if we move the sv_flags before the refcnt, and use most refcnt bytes (leaving one, with the highest bit for this special case), we can store more than just 3 chars for 32bit and 7 chars for 64bit. max 4 more on 32bit and 8 more on 64bit.","files":null}]}
