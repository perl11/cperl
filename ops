The error message you report above indicates a log file where there is more detail. My suggestion is to take that log and create a github [gist](https://gist.github.com/) for it and link it to your issue.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"386dae3b5201a6e26c5146aa0b574341b2249645"},"timestamp":1524558722,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4Mzg0OTQwOQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/359#issuecomment-383849409"},"message":"Here is the full log\n\n[https://gist.github.com/zdm/ab81c94288b5bdee46d08a31135cdbb3](https://gist.github.com/zdm/ab81c94288b5bdee46d08a31135cdbb3)","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"04135dc995e2fdcd322aaf4268dbf04630a3cc7c"},"timestamp":1524560616,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4Mzg1ODgyMQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/359#issuecomment-383858821"},"message":"Nope, not me.\n\nThat’s the p5p version:\nXSAWYERX/Storable-3.09\np5p took over maintenance again.\n\nI’m still working on the fixes, in my 3.06 branch.\n\nThis version is missing a `lib/Storable/Limit.pm` rule in the Makefile. \ncperl had that fixed, but they changed the stack sizes from an hardcoded internal header file to be user-editable in Storable::Limit.\n\n\u003e On Apr 24, 2018, at 4:20 AM, zdm \u003cnotifications@github.com\u003e wrote:\n\u003e \n\u003e Hi,\n\u003e I post this issue here, because of:\n\u003e \n\u003e Storable was written by Raphael Manfredi \u003cRaphael_Manfredi@pobox.com\u003e Maintenance is now done by cperl http://perl11.org/cperl\n\u003e \n\u003e and I didn't found any other ways to report this bug.\n\u003e \n\u003e So, Storable v3.09 not build under strawberry perl 5.26.2\n\u003e \n\u003e Checking dependencies from MYMETA.json ...\n\u003e Checking if you have XSLoader 0 ...
