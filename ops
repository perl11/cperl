For example a [typical class](http://perl11.org/cperl/perlclass.html), or script [using types](http://perl11.org/cperl/perltypes.html) and new keywords?\nAnother marketer for this project would be a tutorial how to compile a program using classes to a binary executable file, linked statically or dynamically. Is there such example on the site?\nAnother question is how to create a module for CPAN, which can be tested by cpantesters? Obvously there need to be cperl installed somewhere. How do we recognize in which perl we are? etc. Mostly user questions.\nThanks!","files":null}]}
