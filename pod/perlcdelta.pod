=head1 NAME

perlcdelta - what is new for cperl v5.25.3

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes the differences between the cperl 5.25.2
and the cperl 5.25.3 development releases.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as v5.25.1c, first
read L<perl5252cdelta>, which describes differences between v5.25.1c
and v5.25.2c

=head1 Notice

This cperl version is merged with the perl versions 5.25.3 - 5.25.9.

C<${^ENCODING}> and the encoding pragma was not removed, rather fixed
instead.

The still incomplete and slow implementation for the experimental
subroutine signatures feature from 5.25.4 was not added, as cperl's
signatures are twice as fast and have many more features. In detail
the new C<OP_ARGELEM>, C<OP_ARGDEFELEM> and C<OP_ARGCHECK> are not
used, cperl still uses C<OP_SIGNATURE> only.

cperl doesn't use the slow Siphash 1-3 as default on 64bit, and no
hybrid hash function as introduced with 5.25.8. cperl rather uses fast
hash functions and other typical optimizations, while adding proper
security in the collision resolution instead. A hash function can
never ensure DoS safety for a hash table.

=head1 Core Enhancements

=head2 for qw() is legal again

perl5.14 deprecated and 5.18 started disallowing a
L<for|perlsyn/"Statement Modifiers"> loop with a
L<qw()|perlop/"qw/STRING/"> list, "qw-as-parens".

The rationale to remove the handy C<for qw()> syntax was technical and
trivial to fix.  cperl 5.25.3 re-instated it for C<for> loops, but
not for the rest.  cperl does not insist on the backwards syntax to
require C<(qw( ... ))> around the C<for> list.

   cperl5.25.3 -e'for qw(a b c) { print $_ }'

   perl5.18 -e'for (qw(a b c)) { print $_ }'

   perl5.14 -e'for $_ qw(a b c) { print $_ }'
   => Use of qw(...) as parentheses is deprecated at -e line 1

   perl5.12  -e'for $_ qw(a b c) { print $_ }'

The new additional cperl syntax is even easier to use than before.
See L<[cperl #26]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/26>.

=head2 Perl can now do default collation in UTF-8 locales on platforms
that support it

Some platforms natively do a reasonable job of collating and sorting in
UTF-8 locales.  Perl now works with those.  For portability and full
control, L<Unicode::Collate> is still recommended, but now you may
not need to do anything special to get good-enough results, depending on
your application.  See
L<perllocale/Category C<LC_COLLATE>: Collation: Text Comparisons and Sorting>

=head2 Better locale collation of strings containing embedded C<NUL>
characters

In locales that have multi-level character weights, these are now
ignored at the higher priority ones.  There are still some gotchas in
some strings, though.  See
L<perllocale/Collation of strings containing embedded C<NUL> characters>.

=head2 Unescaped literal C<"{"> characters in regular expression
patterns are no longer permissible

You have to now say something like C<"\{"> or C<"[{]"> to specify to
match a LEFT CURLY BRACKET.  This will allow future extensions to the
language.  This restriction is not enforced, nor are there current plans
to enforce it, if the C<"{"> is the first character in the pattern.

These have been deprecated since v5.16, with a deprecation message
displayed starting in v5.22.

=head2 Literal control character variable names are no longer permissible

A variable name may no longer contain a literal control character under
any circumstances.  These previously were allowed in single-character
names on ASCII platforms, but have been deprecated there since Perl
v5.20.  This affects things like C<$I<\cT>>, where I<\cT> is a literal
control (such as a C<NAK> or C<NEGATIVE ACKNOWLEDGE> character) in the
source code.

=head2 New regular expression modifier C</xx>

Specifying two C<x> characters to modify a regular expression pattern
does everything that a single one does, but additionally TAB and SPACE
characters within a bracketed character class are generally ignored and
can be added to improve readability, like
S<C</[ ^ A-Z d-f p-x ]/xx>>.  Details are at
L<perlre/E<sol>x and E<sol>xx>.

=head2 C<NBSP> is no longer permissible in C<\N{...}>

The name of a character may no longer contain non-breaking spaces.  It
has been deprecated to do so since Perl v5.22.

=head2 C<CORE> subroutines for hash and array functions callable via
reference

The hash and array functions in the C<CORE> namespace--C<keys>, C<each>,
C<values>, C<push>, C<pop>, C<shift>, C<unshift> and C<splice>--, can now
be called with ampersand syntax (C<&CORE::keys(\%hash>) and via reference
(C<< my $k = \&CORE::keys; $k->(\%hash) >>).  Previously they could only be
used when inlined.

=head2 Unicode 9.0 is now supported

A list of changes is at
L<http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode9.0.0/>.  Modules that are
shipped with core Perl but not maintained by p5p do not necessarily
support Unicode 9.0.  L<Unicode::Normalize> does work on 9.0.

Note that some changed UCD database files in 9.0 stayed renamed to their
shortened name in perl.

=head2 Use of C<\p{I<script>}> uses the improved Script_Extensions property

Unicode 6.0 introduced an improved form of the Script (C<sc>) property, and
called it Script_Extensions (C<scx>).  As of now, Perl uses this improved
version when a property is specified as just C<\p{I<script>}>.  The meaning of
compound forms, like C<\p{sc=I<script>}> are unchanged.  This should make
programs be more accurate when determining if a character is used in a given
script, but there is a slight chance of breakage for programs that very
specifically needed the old behavior.  See L<perlunicode/Scripts>.

=head2 Declaring a reference to a variable

As an experimental feature, Perl now allows the referencing operator to come
after L<C<my()>|perlfunc/my>, L<C<state()>|perlfunc/state>,
L<C<our()>|perlfunc/our>, or L<C<local()>|perlfunc/local>.  This syntax must
be enabled with C<use feature 'declared_refs'>.  It is experimental, and will
warn by default unless C<no warnings 'experimental::refaliasing'> is in effect.
It is intended mainly for use in assignments to references.  For example:

    use experimental 'refaliasing', 'declared_refs';
    my \$a = \$b;

See L<perlref/Assigning to References> for slightly more detail.

Note that this still looks much worse than the perl6 bind operator:
    my $a := $b;

=head2 Indented Here-documents

This adds a new modifier '~' to here-docs that tells the parser
that it should look for /^\s*$DELIM\n/ as the closing delimiter.

These syntaxes are all supported:

    <<~EOF;
    <<~\EOF;
    <<~'EOF';
    <<~"EOF";
    <<~`EOF`;
    <<~ 'EOF';
    <<~ "EOF";
    <<~ `EOF`;

The '~' modifier will strip, from each line in the here-doc, the
same whitespace that appears before the delimiter.

Newlines will be copied as is, and lines that don't include the
proper beginning whitespace will cause perl to croak.

For example:

    if (1) {
      print <<~EOF;
        Hello there
        EOF
    }

prints "Hello there\n" with no leading whitespace.

=head2 '.' and @INC

The old cperl C<-Dfortify_inc> security feature was now also
introduced by perl5 and renamed to C<-Ddefault_inc_excludes_dot>.

Because the testing and make process for perl modules does not work well with
C<.> missing from @INC, cperl and perl5 still support the environment variable
C<PERL_USE_UNSAFE_INC=1> which makes Perl behave as it previously did, returning
C<.> to @INC in all child processes.

=head2 create a safer utf8_hop() called utf8_hop_safe()

Unlike C<utf8_hop()>, C<utf8_hop_safe()> won't navigate before the
beginning or after the end of the supplied buffer.

=head2 @{^CAPTURE}, %{^CAPTURE}, and %{^CAPTURE_ALL}

C<@{^CAPTURE}> exposes the capture buffers of the last match as an array. So C<$1> is
C<${^CAPTURE}[0]>.

C<%{^CAPTURE}> is the equivalent to C<%+> (ie named captures)

C<%{^CAPTURE_ALL}> is the equivalent to C<%-> (ie all named captures).

=head2 Improved .pmc loading

cperl now sets the correct F<.pmc> filename for C<__FILE__> and
C<CopFILE>, when it was loaded from it.

cperl also allows bypassing a F<.pmc> if loaded explicitly via
L<do|perlfunc/do> and an absolute pathname.

This allows improved F<.pmc> file caching of only selective parts of a
module. Such as a method jit, which stores onlt some subs, but not the
whole module in it's cache.  Hence the Cache logic in the F<.pmc> can now
first load the parallel source F<.pm> and then apply the F<.pmc>
optimizations. E.g. by loading a LLVM F<.bc> file contents with only
some subs.

The impact for existing code is low. If you loaded a .pmc via
C<do "/abspath/module.pm"> you need to add now a final "c" explictly:
C<do "/abspath/module.pmc">.

With perl5 upstream those two longstanding PMC bugs made it
impossible to use a partial Byte- or JitCache.
It also makes it possible to re-instate the old python-like timestamp
logic which was removed for pugs 2006 with commit
L<a91233bf4cf|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/commit/a91233bf4cf6a12df8935c3530a6ca900ca6ca2f>.

L<[cperl #244]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/244>.

=head1 Security

=head2 "Escaped" colons and relative paths in PATH

On Unix systems, Perl treats any relative paths in the PATH environment
variable as tainted when starting a new process.  Previously, it was
allowing a backslash to escape a colon (unlike the OS), consequently
allowing relative paths to be considered safe if the PATH was set to
something like C</\:.>.  The check has been fixed to treat C<.> as tainted
in that example.

=head2 Unicode identifiers: Moderately Restrictive Level

cperl as first dynamic scripting language follows the B<General
Security Profile> for identifiers in programming languages.

B<Moderately Restrictive>: Allow C<Latin> with other Recommended or
Aspirational scripts except C<Cyrillic> and C<Greek>. Otherwise, the same as
L<Highly Restrictive|http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr39/#Identifier_Characters>,
i.e. allow C<:Japanese>, C<:Korean> and C<:Hanb>.

I<<< "Some characters are not in modern customary use, and thus implementations
may want to exclude them from identifiers.  These include characters in
historic and obsolete scripts, scripts used mostly liturgically, and
regional scripts used only in very small communities or with very limited
current usage.  The set of characters in Table 4, Candidate Characters for
Exclusion from Identifiers provides candidates of these." >>>

cperl honors the
L<TR31 Candidate Characters for Exclusion from Identifiers|http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr31/#Table_Candidate_Characters_for_Exclusion_from_Identifiers>

I.e. You may still declare those scripts as valid, but they are not
automatically allowed, similar to the need to declare mixed scripts.

    use utf8;
    my $ᭅ = 1; # \x{1b45} BALINESE LETTER KAF SASAK

=> Invalid script Balinese in identifier ᭅ for U+1B45

    use utf8 'Balinese';
    my $ᭅ = 1; # \x{1b45} BALINESE LETTER KAF SASAK
    print "ok";

=>

     ok

The scripts listed at "Table 6, Aspirational Use Scripts":
C<Canadian_Aboriginal>, C<Miao>, C<Mongolian>, C<Tifinagh> and C<Yi>
are included, i.e. need not to be declared.

With this restriction we are close to the implementation of the
Moderately Restrictive level for identifiers by default. See
L<http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr39/#General_Security_Profile> and
L<http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr36/#Security_Levels_and_Alerts>.

With special declarations of the used scripts you can weaken the
restriction level to B<Minimally Restrictive>.

Missing for the B<Moderately Restrictive> level are warnings on
single-, mixed and whole-script confusables, and warnings on certain
incompatible mixed-script pairs such as B<Greek + Cyrillic>.

All utf8 encoded names are checked for wellformed-ness.

=head2 C<chdir> heap-buffer-overflow on the perl stack

When called without argument it overwrote subsequent stack entries
with the easily controllable result.
L<[perl #129130]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=129130>

=head1 Incompatible Changes

=head2 String delimiters that aren't stand-alone graphemes are illegal

In order for Perl to eventually allow string delimiters to be Unicode
grapheme clusters (which look like a single character, but may be
a sequence of several ones), we stop allowing a single char
delimiter that isn't a grapheme by itself.  These are unlikely to exist
in actual code, as they would typically display as attached to the
character in front of them.

E.g. C<qr ̂foobar̂;> is now an error, it is only deprecated with v5.25.9
upstream and will be illegal in perl5 v5.30.

=head2 for state loops still illegal

perl5.25.3 started allowing state variables in loops.
cperl still disallows them.

    perl5.25.3 -E'use feature "declared_refs","refaliasing";
                 for state \$x (\$y) { print $x }'
    => warnings: Declaring references is experimental at -e line 1.
    Aliasing via reference is experimental at -e line 1.

    cperl5.25.3 -E'use feature "declared_refs","refaliasing";
                 for state \$x (\$y) { print $x }'
    => error: Missing $ on loop variable at -e line 1.

and without declared_refs:

    perl5.25.3 -E'for state $x ($y) { print $x }'

    cperl5.25.3 -E'for state $x ($y) { print $x }'
    => error: Missing $ on loop variable at -e line 1.

=head2 C<scalar(%hash)> return value changed

The value returned for C<scalar(%hash)> will no longer show information about
the buckets allocated in the hash.  It will simply return the count of used
keys.  It is thus equivalent to C<0+keys(%hash)>.

A form of backwards compatibility is provided via C<Hash::Util::bucket_ratio()>
which provides the same behavior as C<scalar(%hash)> provided prior to Perl
5.25.

=head2 C<keys> returned from an lvalue subroutine

C<keys> returned from an lvalue subroutine can no longer be assigned
to in list context.

    sub foo : lvalue { keys(%INC) }
    (foo) = 3; # death
    sub bar : lvalue { keys(@_) }
    (bar) = 3; # also an error

This makes the lvalue sub case consistent with C<(keys %hash) = ...> and
C<(keys @_) = ...>, which are also errors.  L<[perl #128187]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128187>

=head1 Performance Enhancements

=over 4

=item * readline is faster

Reading from a file line-by-line with C<readline()> or C<< E<lt>E<gt> >> should
now typically be faster due to a better implementation of the code that
searches for the next newline character.

=item *

C<$ref1 = $ref2> has been optimized.

=item *

Array and hash assignment are now faster, e.g.

    (..., @a) = (...);
    (..., %h) = (...);

especially when the RHS is empty.

Note that perl5 hash assignment is still inferior to cperl hash assignment.

=item *

Reduce the number of odd special cases for the SvSCREAM flag.

=item *

Avoid C<sv_catpvn()> in C<do_vop()> when unneeded.

=item *

Enhancements in Regex concat COW implementation.

=item *

Speed up AV and HV clearing/undeffing.

=item *

Converting a single-digit string to a number is now substantially faster.

=item *

The internal op implementing the C<split> builtin has been simplified and
sped up. Firstly, it no longer requires a subsidiary internal C<pushre> op
to do its work. Secondly, code of the form C<my @x = split(...)> is now
optimised in the same way as C<@x = split(...)>, and is therefore a few
percent faster.

=item *

Bareword constant strings are now permitted to take part in constant
folding. They were originally exempted from constant folding in August 1999,
during the development of Perl 5.6, to ensure that C<use strict "subs">
would still apply to bareword constants. That has now been accomplished a
different way, so barewords, like other constants, now gain the performance
benefits of constant folding.

This also means that void-context warnings on constant expressions of
barewords now report the folded constant operand, rather than the operation;
this matches the behaviour for non-bareword constants.

=head1 Utility Changes

=head2 F<Porting/bench.pl>

=over 4

=item *

allow per-PUT (perl under test) options and modules

Rework process_perls() to give a richer usage / API, allowing
additional command-line options, specific to each Perl-Under-Test.
For example:

    Porting/bench.pl -- perl=plain perl=slower -Mstrict -DmpMA

The above runs the same perl-exe for 2 different tests (PUTS), but
adds expensive debugging options to only the 2nd PUT.

=item *

provide per-PUT environment

    $ perl Porting/bench.pl --jobs=2 \
       --verbose --debug --tests=/loop::for::pkg_/ \
       -- \
       cperl5.25.3:+bare \
       cperl5.25.3=+full:PERL_MEM_LOG=3mst,PERLIO=:stdio -MData::Dumper

this will run:

    PERL_HASH_SEED=0 PERLIO=:stdio PERL_MEM_LOG=3mst valgrind \
      --tool=cachegrind --branch-sim=yes --cachegrind-out-file=/dev/null \
      cperl5.25.3  -MData::Dumper - 20 2>&1

Note that ':' is now a valid separator between the perl & label, but
not between ENVAR=value pairs, where a ',' is required.

=item *

store data using unique label, not perl-exe, which may be used 2x

=item *

add B<=+label> feature, which appends the label to perl-name

Using this reduces the burden of keeping each label unique,

C<usedtrace> is now default on newer darwin. cperl only.

If the C<-xnolibs> is available, use that so a F<dtrace> perl can be
built within a FreeBSD jail.

=item *

On systems that build a dtrace object file (FreeBSD, Solaris and
SystemTap's dtrace emulation), copy the input objects to a separate
directory and process them there, and use those objects in the link,
since C<dtrace -G> also modifies these objects.

Add F<libelf> to the build on FreeBSD 10.x, since dtrace adds references
to libelf symbols.

Generate a dummy F<dtrace_main.o> if C<dtrace -G> fails to build it.  A
default build on Solaris generates probes from the unused inline
functions, while they don't on FreeBSD, which causes C<dtrace -G> to
fail.

Some parts of the test suite that try to exhaustively test edge cases in the

In addition, some of those test cases have been split into more files, to

=head1 Internal Changes

=over 4

=item *

New versions of macros like C<isALPHA_utf8> and C<toLOWER_utf8>  have
been added, each with the
suffix C<_safe>, like C<isSPACE_utf8_safe>.  These take an extra
parameter, giving an upper limit of how far into the string it is safe
to read.  Using the old versions could cause attempts to read beyond the
end of the input buffer if the UTF-8 is not well-formed, and ther use
now raises a deprecation warning.  Details are at
L<perlapi/Character classification>.

=item *

Calling macros like C<isALPHA_utf8> on malformed UTF-8 have issued a
deprecation warning since Perl v5.18.  They now die.
Similarly, macros like C<toLOWER_utf8> on malformed UTF-8 now die.

=item *

Calling the functions C<utf8n_to_uvchr> and its derivatives, while
passing a string length of 0 is now asserted against in DEBUGGING
builds, and otherwise returns the Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER.   If
you have nothing to decode, you shouldn't call the decode function.

=item *

The functions C<utf8n_to_uvchr> and its derivatives now return the
Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER if called with UTF-8 that has the overlong
malformation, and that malformation is allowed by the input parameters.
This malformation is where the UTF-8 looks valid syntactically, but
there is a shorter sequence that yields the same code point.  This has
been forbidden since Unicode version 3.1.

=item *

The functions C<utf8n_to_uvchr> and its derivatives now accept an input
flag to allow the overflow malformation.  This malformation is when the
UTF-8 may be syntactically valid, but the code point it represents is
not capable of being represented in the word length on the platform.
What "allowed" means in this case is that the function doesn't return an
error, and advances the parse pointer to beyond the UTF-8 in question,
but it returns the Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER as the value of the
code point (since the real value is not representable).

=item *

The meanings of some internal SV flags have been changed

OPpRUNTIME, SVpbm_VALID, SVpbm_TAIL, SvTAIL_on, SvTAIL_off, SVrepl_EVAL,
SvEVALED

=item *

Change C<hv_fetch(…, "…", …, …)> to C<hv_fetchs(…, "…", …)>

The dual-life dists all use Devel::PPPort, so they can use this function even
though it was only added in 5.10.

=item *

The function C<L<perlapi/utf8n_to_uvchr>> has been changed to not
abandon searching for other malformations when the first one is
encountered.  A call to it thus can generate multiple diagnostics,
instead of just one.

=item *

A new function, C<L<perlapi/utf8n_to_uvchr_error>>, has been added for
use by modules that need to know the details of UTF-8 malformations
beyond pass/fail.  Previously, the only ways to know why a sequence was
ill-formed was to capture and parse the generated diagnostics, or to do
your own analysis.

=item *

Several new functions for handling Unicode have been added to the API:
C<L<perlapi/is_strict_utf8_string>>,
C<L<perlapi/is_c9strict_utf8_string>>,
C<L<perlapi/is_utf8_string_flags>>,
C<L<perlapi/is_strict_utf8_string_loc>>,
C<L<perlapi/is_strict_utf8_string_loclen>>,
C<L<perlapi/is_c9strict_utf8_string_loc>>,
C<L<perlapi/is_c9strict_utf8_string_loclen>>,
C<L<perlapi/is_utf8_string_loc_flags>>,
C<L<perlapi/is_utf8_string_loclen_flags>>,
C<L<perlapi/is_utf8_fixed_width_buf_flags>>,
C<L<perlapi/is_utf8_fixed_width_buf_loc_flags>>,
C<L<perlapi/is_utf8_fixed_width_buf_loclen_flags>>.

These functions are all extensions of the C<is_utf8_string_*()> functions,
that apply various restrictions to the UTF-8 recognized as valid.

=item *

A new API function C<sv_setvpv_bufsize()> allows simultaneously setting the
length and allocated size of the buffer in an C<SV>, growing the buffer if
necessary.

=item *

A new API macro C<SvPVCLEAR()> sets its C<SV> argument to an empty string,
like Perl-space C<$x = ''>, but with several optimisations.

=item *

All parts of the internals now agree that the C<sassign> op is a C<BINOP>;
previously it was listed as a C<BASEOP> in F<regen/opcodes>, which meant
that several parts of the internals had to be special-cased to accommodate
it. This oddity's original motivation was to handle code like C<$x ||= 1>;
that is now handled in a simpler way.

=item *

Several new internal C macros have been added that take a string literal as
arguments, alongside existing routines that take the equivalent value as two
arguments, a character pointer and a length. The advantage of this is that
the length of the string is calculated automatically, rather than having to
be done manually. These routines are now used where appropriate across the
entire codebase.

Note that these upstream changes are still inferior to the cperl specific
memEQc and strEQc macros, which do faster word-wordwise comparisons at
run-time.

=item *

The code in F<gv.c> that determines whether a variable has a special meaning
to Perl has been simplified.

=item *

The C<DEBUGGING>-mode output for regex compilation and execution has been
enhanced.

=item *

Several macros and functions have been added to the public API for
dealing with Unicode and UTF-8-encoded strings.  See
L<perlapi/Unicode Support>.

=item *

Use C<my_strlcat()> in C<locale.c>. While C<strcat()> is safe in this context,
some compilers were optimizing this to C<strcpy()> causing a porting test to
fail that looks for unsafe code. Rather than fighting this, we just use
C<my_strlcat()> instead.

=item *

Perl no longer panics when switching into some locales on machines with
buggy C<strxfrm()> implementations in their libc.

List assignment in list context where the LHS contained aggregates and
where there were not enough RHS elements, used to skip scalar lvalues.
Previously, C<(($a,$b,@c,$d) = (1))> in list context returned C<($a)>; now
it returns C<($a,$b,$d)>. C<(($a,$b,$c) = (1))> is unchanged: it still
returns C<($a,$b,$c)>. This can be seen in the following:

    sub inc { $_++ for @_ }
    inc(($a,$b,@c,$d) = (10))

Formerly, the values of C<($a,$b,$d)> would be left as C<(11,undef,undef)>;
now they are C<(11,1,1)>.

=item *

L<[perl #129903]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=129903>

The basic problem is that code like this: /(?{ s!!! })/ can trigger infinite
recursion on the C stack (not the normal perl stack) when the last successful
pattern in scope is itself. Since the C stack overflows this manifests as an
untrappable error/segfault, which then kills perl.

We avoid the segfault by simply forbidding the use of the empty pattern when it
would resolve to the currently executing pattern.

Problems with in-place array sorts: code like C<@a = sort { ... } @a>,

128 and 255 has been fixed. L<[perl #128734]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128734>.

=item *

A regression from the previous development release, 5.23.3, where
compiling a regular expression could crash the interpreter has been
fixed. L<[perl #128686]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128686>.

=item *

Use of a string delimiter whose code point is above 2**31 now works
correctly on platforms that allow this.  Previously, certain characters,
due to truncation, would be confused with other delimiter characters
with special meaning (such as C<?> in C<m?...?>), resulting
in inconsistent behaviour.  Note that this is non-portable,
and is based on Perl's extension to UTF-8, and is probably not
displayable nor enterable by any editor.
L<[perl #128738]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128738>

=item *

C<@{x> followed by a newline where C<x> represents a control or non-ASCII
character no longer produces a garbled syntax error message or a crash.
L<[perl #128951]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128951>

=item *

An assertion failure with C<%: = 0> has been fixed.
L<[perl #128238]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128238>

=item *

In Perl 5.18, the parsing of C<"$foo::$bar"> was accidentally changed, such
that it would be treated as C<$foo."::".$bar>.  The previous behavior, which
was to parse it as C<$foo:: . $bar>, has been restored.
L<[perl #128478]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128478>

=item *

Since Perl 5.20, line numbers have been off by one when perl is invoked with
the B<-x> switch.  This has been fixed.
L<[perl #128508]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128508>

=item *

Vivifying a subroutine stub in a deleted stash (e.g., C<delete $My::{"Foo::"};
\&My::Foo::foo>) no longer crashes.  It had begun crashing in Perl 5.18.
L<[perl #128532]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128532>

=item *

Some obscure cases of subroutines and file handles being freed at the same time
could result in crashes, but have been fixed.  The crash was introduced in Perl
5.22.
L<[perl #128597]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128597>

=item *

Code that looks for a variable name associated with an uninitialized value
could cause an assertion in cases where magic is involved, such as
C<$ISA[0][0]>.  This has now been fixed.
L<[perl #128253]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128253>

=item *

A crash caused by code generating the warning "Subroutine STASH::NAME
redefined" in cases such as C<sub P::f{} undef *P::; *P::f =sub{};> has been
fixed.  In these cases, where the STASH is missing, the warning will now appear
as "Subroutine NAME redefined".
L<[perl #128257]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128257>

=item *

Fixed an assertion triggered by some code that handles deprecated behavior in
formats, e.g. in cases like this:

    format STDOUT =
    @
    0"$x"

L<[perl #128255]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128255>

=item *

A possible divide by zero in string transformation code on Windows has been
avoided, fixing a crash when collating an empty string.
L<[perl #128618]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128618>

=item *

Some regular expression parsing glitches could lead to assertion failures with
regular expressions such as C</(?<=/> and C</(?<!/>.  This has now been fixed.
L<[perl #128170]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128170>

=item *

Non-ASCII string delimiters are now reported correctly in error messages
for unterminated strings.
L<[perl #128701]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128701>

=item *

Scalar C<keys %hash> can now be assigned to consistently in all scalar
lvalue contexts.  Previously it worked for some contexts but not others.

=item *

C< ${\vec %h, 0, 1} > and C< ${\substr %h, 0} > do not segfault anymore, rather
the lvalue context is propagated, and list context properly handled.
