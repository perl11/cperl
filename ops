Include\n    netinet/ip.h, netinet/ip6.h, netinet6/in6.h if valid.\n\nNet-Ping 2.50 (private)\n    Upstream development stalled at both cpan and p5p. Now also at\n    https://github.com/rurban/net-ping\n\n    New Features:\n\n    - Handle IPv6 addresses and the AF_INET6 family.\n\n    - Added the optional family argument to most methods. valid values:\n    6, \"v6\", \"ip6\", \"ipv6\", AF_INET6\n\n    - new can take now named arguments, a hashref.\n\n    - Added the following named arguments to new: gateway host bind\n    retrans pingstring source_verify econnrefused IPV6_USE_MIN_MTU\n    IPV6_RECVPATHMTU IPV6_HOPLIMIT\n\n    - Added the wakeonlan method\n\n    - Improve argument default handling\n\n    - Added missing documentation\n\nbignum 0.42\n    uses new Math::Big*, fixing inf/nan. fix bignum::bpi, use bpi() as a\n    class method, not a function.\n\nMath::BigInt::FastCalc 0.40\n    Only minor changes\n\nMath::BigRat 0.260802\n    Fix blog() for inf/nan, and more. See\n    \u003chttps://metacpan.org/changes/distribution/Math-BigRat\u003e\n\nMath::BigInt 1.999716\n    Tons of changes from 1.999701 See\n    \u003chttps://metacpan.org/changes/distribution/Math-BigInt\u003e\n\nLocale::Codes 3.38\n    But kept the deprecated \"Locale::Codes::Country::alias_code\"\n    function.\n\n    Improved test suite (and made some changes to Codes.pm) based on\n    Devel::Cover. Test suite now has 100% coverage.\n\nIPC::SysV 2.06\n    shmat() with illegal id fails and sets errno\n\nIPC::Cmd 0.94\n    * move __END__ above POD in documentation (plicease)\n\n    * Don't clobber $SIG{__DIE__} and $SIG{__WARN__} in open3_run()\n    (avar)\n\n    * Fix 'terminate_on_signal' segfaulting (Petya Kohts)\n\n    * Fix usage of fcntl(..., F_GETFL, ...) (tonyc)\n\nGetopt::Long 2.48\n    Fixed gnu_getopt option not 100% identical to GNU getopt [RT #12675]\n    \u003chttps://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=39052\u003e\n\n    Fixed parsing valid real numeric values, e.g. --num=.1 [RT #89513]\n    \u003chttps://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=89513\u003e\n\n    PAT_FLOAT =\u003e\n    \"[-+]?(?=[0-9.])[0-9_]*(\\.[0-9_]+)?([eE][-+]?[0-9_]+)?\";\n\nFile::Path 2.12\n    Tons of fixes from 2.09\n\nExtUtils::ParseXS 3.30\n    Fix quoting if $^X has spaces\n\nExtUtils::Command removed\n    Now merged into ExtUtils-MakeMaker-7.10\n\nExtUtils::CBuilder 0.280224\n    Use warnings/strict on all modules\n\nDigest-MD5 2.55_01\n    cperl only: Fix alignment probe for 64bit and enforce a SIGBUS on\n    intel also (at least with gnu c compatible compilers: gcc, clang,\n    icc) to mimic errors on other strict platforms: sparc, mips, ppc\n\n    Allows now 64bit and darwin multiarch to be probed.\n\n    Adds now coverage for the previously never tested branch for\n    -UU32_ALIGNMENT_REQUIRED.\n\n    Fixes RT #77919\n\n    See https://github.com/rurban/digest-md5/tree/intel-align-rt77919\n\nDevel-PPPort 3.32_02\n    cperl added support for 5.16 binary names See\n    https://github.com/rurban/Devel-PPPort/tree/516gvhv\n\nConfig-Perl-V 0.25_01\n    Added v5.24 and cperl support.\n\nCarp 1.38\n    $Carp::MaxArgNums is no longer treated as if it was one larger.\n\nCPAN-Meta-YAML 0.018\n    Removed t/00-report-prereqs.dd template.\n\n    Generated from \"ETHER/YAML-Tiny-1.69\"\n\n    Tests no longer print to stderr unnecessarily. This makes core perl\n    builds a little quieter.\n\n    The Test::More dependency has been reduced to 0.88 by emulating\n    'subtest' for those tests that need it.\n\n    Instead of erroring on duplicate keys found in a hash (introduced in\n    version 1.63), now we only warn. This fixes an issue in Strawberry\n    Perl (via CPAN::Meta::YAML) when parsing a configuration file.\n\nCPAN-Meta-Requirements 3.140c\n    Handle cperl-specific 'c' version suffices.\n\n    Protect internal _isa_version from non-refs that pass -\u003eisa(version)\n\n    Added method for getting structured requirements\n\n    In fixing preservation of \"0.00\", some Module =\u003e 0 optimizations\n    were lost; this restores those optimizations\n\nPod::Usage 1.68\n    CPAN#110443: [PATCH] fix -perldoc option in pod2usage() method.\n    added missing '-'\n\n    CPAN#110446: [feature request] -perldocopt for supplying perldoc\n    options added this option; split of string on whitespace is not\n    optimal, but should do the job\n\nTest::Harness 3.36\n    Accept YAML with trailing whitespace in header (Maik Hentsche)\n\nFilter::Util::Call 1.55\n    Improved Filter documentation, esp. document that __DATA__ is not\n    filtered.\n\nScalar-List-Utils 1.45\n    Renamed existing uniq() to uniqstr() Canonicalise undef to {empty\n    string,zero} in uniq{str,num}() Add a new uniq() with more DWIMish\n    semantics around undef\n\n    Fix uses of GET magic by the uniq*() family of functions. GET magic\n    is now always invoked exactly once if it exists.\n\n    Added List::Util::uniq() and uniqnum()\n\n    Fix build on non-C99 compilers\n\n    * Avoid divide-by-zero exception if product()'s accumulator is IV\n    zero (RT105415) * Possible fix for SvTEMP issues in first and\n    any/all/none/notall (RT96343)\n\nEncode 2.84\n    Encode::MIME::Header\n\n    Both decoder and encoder are rewritten by Pali Roh√°r. Encoder should\n    be now fully compliant of RFC 2047. Decoder is less strict to be\n    able to decode strings generated by old versions of this module.\n    This fixed a couple of related decode('MIME-header') /\n    encode('MIME-header') bugs and tickets.\n\n    Encode::Unicode\n\n    Fix RT#107043: If no BOM is found, the routine dies. When you decode\n    from UTF-(16|32) without -BE or LE without BOM, Encode now assumes\n    BE accordingly to RFC2781 and the Unicode Standard version 8.0\n\n    Precompile 1252 table as that is now the Pod::Simple default\n\n    Fixed compilation under -pedantic\n\nTime::HiRes 1.9732\n    Compilation cleanup, remove hrt_ualarm, hrt_ualarm_itimer\n\n    new constants: CLOCK_BOOTTIME CLOCK_HIGHRES CLOCK_MONOTONIC_COARSE\n    CLOCK_MONOTONIC_PRECISE CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW CLOCK_REALTIME_COARSE\n    CLOCK_REALTIME_FAST CLOCK_REALTIME_PRECISE CLOCK_SECOND [RT #111170]\n    \u003chttps://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=111170\u003e\n\n    clock_getres(), clock_gettime(), clock_nanosleep() emulation for OS\n    X [RT #78566] \u003chttps://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=78566\u003e\n\nStorable 2.53_03\n    Add new optional flags argument to retrieve()/thaw() for flags, or\n    set new global $Storable::flags: 2 for BLESS_OK | 4 TIE_OK. default\n    6. With 0 disable blessing and tieing of objects for proper\n    security.\n\n    Compute CAN_FLOCK at compile-time, to avoid Config in perlcc\n    compiled binaries.\n\n    Broke support for restoring restricted hashes [perl #73972] with the\n    new default PERL_PERTURB_KEYS_TOP strategy.\n\nCPAN::Meta (private)\n    Favour the new builtin XS YAML and JSON variants over PP. Improve\n    the validator tests.\n\nParse::CPAN::Meta (private)\n    Favour the new builtin XS YAML and JSON variants over PP.\n\nExtUtils::Constant 0.23_03\n    Fixed fatal typos, moved from cpan to dist.\n\nModule::CoreList 5.20160225c\n    Fixed all 'c' suffix version checks.\n\nCPAN::Meta::Requirements (private)\n    Handle 'c' suffix version checks.\n\n    cperl accepts versions with and without c, and should not warn about\n    not existing, builtin modules (XSLoader, DynaLoader, strict,\n    attributes) or unparsable versions. [cperl #104]\n\n    * Accept the c suffix * perl5 should fail with a c version. * A\n    requirement of a c version can only be fulfilled by cperl\n    (currently).\n\nCPAN (private)\n    Fix prerequisite and version checks, Allow cperl c suffices, Honor\n    cperl builtin modules\n\nExtUtils::MakeMaker 8.04_03 (private)\n    Protect our cperl changes and non-upstream improvements:\n\n    Fixed prereq check for cperl builtins, 'c' version suffix support,\n    make -s silencing, fixed wrong Config dependencies,\n    PERL_USE_UNSAFE_INC=1, call darwin dsymutil\n\nConfig 6.19\n    Config is now a XS module, synced with CPAN as XSConfig. The Config\n    tables are now readonly, and many more memory improvements.\n\nB::Concise 0.998c\n    Support gv(cvname). Do not print gv(IV \\\"$$\"), the prototype as ref,\n    rather the name of the cvref. [cperl #96]\n\n    Avoid uninit hr-\u003ename warning.\n\nPod::Simple\n    Stabilize broken t/search50.t search test\n\nthreads 2.02_01\n    Protect \"ithread_free\" from deleted \"PL_modglobal\" during global\n    destruction.\n\nExtUtils::Embed 1.34c\n    Optimize \"boot_DynaLoader\", fix a couple of stack errors.\n\nTest::Harness\n    Fix 2 tests broken with readonly Config.\n\nTime::HiRes 1.9727_02\n    To improve parallel builds on Windows.\n\nXSLoader 1.01c\n    Support utf8-encoded XS modulenames. Fixed load_file 2nd arg.\n    Improve load_file errmsg, print the missing sofile. Protect from\n    underflow: use a signed i counter, which can underflow Fixed memory\n    corruption caused by a negative SvCUR. GH #66 Use labs instead of\n    abs on an 64bit IV value.\n\n    Beware: untested and platform incompatible.\n\nDynaLoader 2.01c\n    Fixed typo @shared_objects. It is named @dl_shared_objects. This\n    broke \"perlcc --staticxs\" (#71)\n\n    Set the IOK bit for dl_expand, caught by the compiler.\n\nB 1.58_02\n    Fix B::UNOP_AUX::aux_list design with threads. No 2nd cv arg, return\n    the PADOFFSET not the SV. (#76)\n\n    Export SVt_ types. (#80)\n\nSafe 2.39_02c\n    Fixed Safe version 'c' problem. Do not check the XS_VERSION of\n    Opcode, because it has a cperl 'c' suffix, which is not yet fully\n    supported in the version check code.\n\nversion\n    Add a scmp method for string comparison, needed to destinguish\n    between 0.2 and 0.2c but only enforced if the version object is\n    stringified. Using eq is not enough.\n\n    fix c suffix comparisons: stringify v0.2c to v0.2c, 0.2c to 0.2c\n    numify 0.2c to 0.002 [0 200], same as 0.2\n\nconstant 1.34\n    Lower memory usage\n\nIPC::SysV\n    Fixed shmat with negative id. The negative argument will be\n    interpreted as a very large unsigned value. Coverity CWE-687\n\nScalar-List-Utils\n    Avoid div by zero [coverity] Note: fixed differently upstream, with\n    much more branches than here.\n\nIO-Compress, Compress-Raw-{Zlib,Bzip2} 2.069\n    static const some local tables.\n```\n## Not Updated Modules and Pragmata\n\nThese modules are currently not ready to be updated.\n- Pod::Checker 1.71\n  \n  See https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=113846\n- MakeUtils::MakeMaker 7.11_06\n  \n  broken for -Dfortify_inc, no \".\" in @INC\n- version 0.9916\n  \n  Broken new \"_\" logic when merged with our 'c' suffix logic.","files":null}]}
