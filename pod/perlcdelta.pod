=head1 NAME

perlcdelta - what is new for cperl v5.27.2

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes the differences between the cperl 5.27.1
and the cperl 5.27.2 releases.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as v5.24.2c, first
read the L<perl526*cdelta> documentation, which describes differences
between v5.26.0c and v5.26.2c

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

=head2 Optimize static methods to subs

When a method call can be proven at compile-time to use a specific
subroutine, optimize away the run-time method dispatch on a non-threaded perl.
When it is for a XS subroutine, such as with e.g. C<use strict;> which does
C<< BEGIN {require strict;} strict->import; >> the C<< strict->import >>
part is optimized from the slow C<entersub> op to the C<enterxssub> op,
as if via C<strict::import("strict",...)>.
The slow GV lookup in entersub cannot be converted to a faster CVref lookup,
as this would break dynamic method redefinitions.
See L<http://blogs.perl.org/users/rurban/2011/06/how-perl-calls-subs-and-methods.html>.
This is ~4% faster for each such method call.

=head2 Dump more COP fields

Dump the values of a COP C<$^H>, C<%^H> and the lexical warnings via
C<op_dump()> and it's XS module L<Devel::Peek>.
Improve the display of cop SEQ values and ranges, and padnames.
Added a DEBUGGING C<cop_dump()> helper, esp. useful for deleted C<PL_curcop>'s.

=head2 More unicode ops

Added the strong unicode fraction op C</> U+2044, which binds stronger
than all other arithmetic ops, and the two unicode multiplication ops
C<⋅> U+022C5 (dot operator) and C<∙> U+2219 (multiplication dot),
which binds the same as C<*>.

=head2 L<C<delete>|perlfunc/delete EXPR> on key/value slices

L<C<delete>|perlfunc/delete EXPR> can now be used on key/value slices,
returning the keys along with the deleted values.
L<[perl #131328]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=131328>

=head2 Unicode 10.0 is supported

A list of changes is at
L<http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode10.0.0>.

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

=head2 Comma-less variable lists in formats are no longer allowed

Omitting the commas between variables passed to formats is no longer
allowed.  This has been deprecated since perl 5.000.

=head2 The C<:locked> and C<:unique> attributes have been removed

These have been no-ops and deprecated since perl 5.12 and 5.10,
respectively.

=head2 C<\N{}> with nothing between the braces is now illegal.

This has been deprecated since Perl 5.24.

=head2 Opening the same symbol as both a file and directory handle is no longer allowed

Using open() and opendir() to associate both a filehandle and a dirhandle
to the same symbol (glob or scalar) has been deprecated since Perl 5.10.

=head2 Use of bare C<< << >> to mean C<< <<"" >> is no longer allowed

Use of a bare terminator has been deprecated since Perl 5.000.

=head2 Setting $/ to a reference to a non-positive integer no longer allowed

This used to work like setting it to C<undef>, but has been deprecated
since Perl 5.20.

=head2 Unicode code points with values exceeding C<IV_MAX> are now fatal.

This was deprecated since Perl 5.24.

=head2 C<B::OP::terse> no longer exists.

Use C<B::Concise::b_terse> instead.

=head2 Use of inherited AUTOLOAD for non-methods is no longer allowed.

This was deprecated in Perl 5.004.

=head2 Use of strings with code points over 0xFF is not allowed for
bitwise string operators

Code points over 0xFF do not make sense for bitwise operators.

=head2 Backslash no longer escapes colon in PATH for the -S switch

Previously the C<-S> switch incorrectly treated backslash ("\") as an
escape for colon when traversing the C<PATH> environment variable.
L<[perl #129183]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=129183>

=head1 Deprecations

=head2 Use of L<C<vec>|perlfunc/vec EXPR,OFFSET,BITS> on strings with code
points above 0xFF is deprecated.

Use of these is nonsensical, as C<vec> is a bit-oriented operation,
which operates on the underlying UTF-8 representation these strings must
be in, and will likely give unexpected results.

=head2 Some uses of unescaped C<"{"> are no longer fatal

Perl 5.26.0 fatalized some uses of an unescaped left brace, but an
exception was made at the last minute, specifically crafted to be a
minimal change to allow GNU Autoconf to work.  This code is heavily
depended upon, and continues to use the deprecated usage.  Its use of an
unescaped left brace is one where we have no intention of repurposing
C<"{"> to be something other than itself.

That exception is now generalized to include various other such cases
where the C<"{"> will not be repurposed.  This is to get real experience
with this more complicated change now, in case we need to issue a dot
release if we find other things like Autoconf that are important to work
around.

Note that these uses continue to raise a deprecation message.

=head2 Module removals

XXX Remove this section if inapplicable.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<"deprecated">-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

C<panic: cannot yet adjust field indices when composing role %s::%s into %s %s [cperl #311]">

When copying a method from a role to a class, and the field index from
the role method would be different to a field index in the resulting
class, the method is not yet fixed up to the new indices. A
temp. solution would be to change the ordering of the roles, or to use
the C<< $self->field >> method syntax in the role method.  This should
be fixed before 5.28. Currently we can only alias composed role
methods and we don't change the ordering of the fields.  See L<[cperl

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
L<https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<cperlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If you think it's a cperl specific bug or trust the cperl developers more 
please file an issue at L<https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues>.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
For details of how to report the issue.
