=head1 NAME

YAML::XS - Perl YAML Serialization using XS and libyaml

=for html
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/ingydotnet/yaml-libyaml-pm"><img src="https://travis-ci.org/ingydotnet/yaml-libyaml-pm.png" alt="yaml-libyaml-pm"></a>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use YAML::XS;

    my $yaml = Dump [ 1..4 ];
    my $array = Load $yaml;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Kirill Siminov's C<libyaml> is arguably the best YAML implementation. The C
library is written precisely to the YAML 1.1 specification. It was originally
bound to Python and was later bound to Ruby.

This module is a Perl XS binding to libyaml which offers Perl the best YAML
support to date.

This module exports the functions C<Dump>, C<Load>, C<DumpFile> and
C<LoadFile>. These functions are intended to work exactly like C<YAML.pm>'s
corresponding functions.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

=over

=item C<$YAML::XS::UseCode>


=item C<$YAML::XS::DumpCode>


=item C<$YAML::XS::LoadCode>

If enabled supports deparsing and evaling of code blocks.

=item C<$YAML::XS::QuoteNumericStrings>

When true (the default) strings that look like numbers but have not been
numified will be quoted when dumping.

This ensures leading that things like leading zeros and other formatting are
preserved.

=head1 USING YAML::XS WITH UNICODE

Handling unicode properly in Perl can be a pain. YAML::XS only deals with
streams of utf8 octets. Just remember this:

    $perl = Load($utf8_octets);
    $utf8_octets = Dump($perl);

There are many, many places where things can go wrong with unicode. If you are
having problems, use Devel::Peek on all the possible data points.
