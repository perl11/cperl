=head1 NAME

perlcdelta - what is new for cperl v5.28.1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes the differences between the cperl 5.28.0
and the cperl 5.28.1 release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as v5.26.0c, first
read the L<perl526*cdelta> documentation, which describes differences
between v5.26.0c and v5.26.3c

=head1 Core Enhancements

=head2 Check bless name under use strict names

The second argument to bless, the new classname, is now checked to be a
valid package name identifier when B<strict names> is in effect, and the
name is now normalized.
L<[cperl #376]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/376>

This is a bugfix, but a major compatibility change.

=head1 Performance Enhancements

=over 4

=item Improve newSVpvn_share

Don't downgrade twice, the is_utf8 flags can be taken from the
returned hek, which does the downgrading to bytes already.

=back

=head1 Deprecations

=head2 Undeprecate "Unescaped left brace in regex" warnings and errors

In cperl only the following special unicode groups within regexes are reserved:

   Name:     \N{
   Property: \p{ \P{
   Break:    \b{ \B{
   Code:     \x{ \o{
   Group:    \g{

All other C</{}/> sequences are allowed in cperl and not deprecated
anymore. There's no need to quote the literal C<\{> and C<\}>, only if
it's ambiguous and can be mixed up with those reserved unicode groups.

B<automake> and more widespread utils does not need to be plagued by
spurious "Unescaped left brace in regex" warnings, when they dont need
to be quoted.  We undeprecated those new warnings and errors, there's
nothing more to reserve (yet).

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

=head2 Updated Modules and Pragmata

=over 4

=item L<Archive::Tar> 2.32

Fix absolute path handling on VMS

=item L<CPAN> 2.21_01

Update to 2.21 upstream with our cperl fixes. Some of our fixes were
accepted upstream.

Fixed critical rmtree bug with a symlink crossing mountpoints
previous directory ~/.cpan/build changed before entering tmp-32186,
expected dev=47 ino=244719549, actual dev=47 ino=33303, aborting at
CPAN/Distribution.pm line 591

Add many upstream tests.

Add the distroprefs from CPAN and cperl. Install them by copying them
to your F<~/.cpan/prefs/> or see
L<https://github.com/rurban/distroprefs/>.

=item L<Cwd> 4.75c

Fixed long pathnames test for getcwd() on older systems, like
debian-7.11 i386, which still returns ENAMETOOLONG on large enough
buffers.

Fix the HAS_GET_CURRENT_DIR_NAME check, and the is_ENAMETOOLONG macro.

For getcwd with C<get_current_dir_name()> - i.e. fastcwd - add
abs_path.  See also L<http://perl11.org/blog/fastcwd.html>

=item L<Data::Dumper> 2.172

Restore deparsing support in the XS dumper, on Perl 5.18 and earlier.

Fix bug when dumping globs with quoting (which now happens for
all Unicode glob names)

Behavior change: C<$dumper->Useqq(undef)> is now treated as setting the
"useqq" option, not getting it (and similarly for other options)
L<[perl #113090]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=113090>

Quote glob names better; notably, Unicode globs are
now handled correctly.
L<[perl #119831]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=119831>

=item L<Devel::PPPort> 3.43_04

Fix test with Visual Studio (space in paths) by quoting $0.
Note: This fix is not in the public CPAN release.

=item L<DynaLoader> 2.09c

dl_load_file: set NULL xs (bootstrap). When we find the bootname via
dl_find_symbol early, we still need to set xs from dl_install_xsub().
Coverity CID #165325

=item L<Errno> 1.29_01

Protect from including some avx512 intrinsics directly on mingw.

=item L<File::Path> 3.16_02c

Fix symlink abort crossing mountpoint with CPAN::Distribution
previous directory ~/.cpan/build changed before entering tmp-32186,
expected dev=47 ino=244719549, actual dev=47 ino=33303, aborting at
CPAN/Distribution.pm line 591

Fix method of generating names for dummy users and groups during testing
(i.e. under docker)
L<[cpan #121967]|https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121967>.

=item L<Storable> 3.12_02

Enable >2GB AvFILL check on store_hook (64bit)
Too many references returned by STORABLE_freeze.
It wrapped around previously. Fixes Coverity CID #187854.
Move __Storable__.pm into Storable_pm.PL

=head1 Documentation

=head2 Changes to Existing Documentation

=head3 L<perldata>

=over 4

=item *

Document the perl4-style single-quote C<'> behaviour in identifiers.
See also L<http://perl11.org/blog/quote-identifiers.html>

=back

=head1 Configuration and Compilation

=over 4

=item *

Configure: fix doubleinfbytes=undef ...
#define DOUBLEINFBYTES undef is illegal
Backported from 5.29.0c

=back

=head1 Testing

=over 4

=item *

Skip C<==\d+==WARNING: LeakSanitizer is disabled in forked process>
STDERR messages in some tests.

=item *

Fixed F<t/op/chdir.t> when pwd is a symlink and thus C<abs_path> returns
the real path.  Also fix the inclusion of F<test.pl> and some more
minitests.

The early requirement of F<test.pl>, when not in F<t/> would lead go a
C<fresh_perl> tempfile of F<t/tmpXXXX>, which is then later when we chdir'd
into F<t/> illegal.

=item *

Check for dtrace locking everywhere.
Not only on darwin. Mostly also on solaris, but also on oraclelinux
and Windows 10 now.

=back

=head1 Platform Support

=head2 Platform-Specific Notes

=item mingw

=over

=item Fixed Errno from processing some protected intrinsics directly

which fail with #error "Never use <avx512vpopcntdqintrin.h>, <avx512ifmaintrin.h>
directly; include <immintrin.h> instead.",
#error "Never use <fmaintrin.h> directly; include <immintrin.h> instead.",
#error "Never use <xsavesintrin.h> directly; include <x86intrin.h> instead."

=item Undefine i_dlfcn

on mingw and new architectures. See L<https://sourceforge.net/p/mingw-w64/bugs/25/>

=back

=item MSVC 11.0

Enable HAS_BOOL, fixes F<xkeycheck.h> redefinition errors.

=back

=head1 Internal Changes

=over 4

=item *

Fixed C<getcwd_sv> to add C<abs_path> when using the fast and preferred glibc call
C<get_current_dir_name()>. Until 5.28.1c C<get_current_dir_name()> was never used.
This affected several CPAN modules: DBD::File, CPAN::Distribution, File::Path.

=item *

Fix Unicode methods with -> syntax: keep WAS_UTF8 flag.

See L<[cperl #377]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/377>
A direct method call with C<::> stays utf8,
but a method call with C<<< -> >>> stripped the utf8 flag.
In cperl this lead to an invalid identifier error under strict names.

Føø::Bær::nèw() keeps the METHOP/ENTERSUB utf8 flag in the GV SVOP.  But
with Føø::Bær->nèw() the nèw is stored interim as shared pvn, which strips
off the utf8 to be stored in the strtab - newSVpvn_share: bytes_from_utf8
&is_utf8 - which leads to the conversion to the entersub gv without the utf8
flag.  The WAS_UTF8 flag is not stored.

=back

=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

=over 4

=item *

Fix C<valid_ident()> for 128-255 chars not to use isIDFIRST_A nor
isIDCONT_A, _A does not match them.  Fixes F<t/uni/method.t> for chars
like oslash.
See L<[cperl #377]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/377>

=item *

Fix C<newSVpvn_share> to store the HEK_WASUTF8 flag if downgraded.
Improve C<newSVpvn_share> to downgrade only once, not twice.

A shared string and a GV with chars in the range 128-255 are downgraded to
bytes without the UTF8 flag. Store at least the HEK_WASUTF8 flag then.

=item *

Check bless name under use strict names.

The second argument to bless, the new classname, is now checked to be a
valid package name identifier when B<strict names> is in effect, and the
name is now normalized.
L<[cperl #376]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/376>

=item *

Fix cperl 5.28.0c regression disallowing calling subnames with a quote
in a package qualifier position.
L<[cperl #371]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/371>

This is now valid again:

  sub don't { 0 } print don't;

With v5.28.0c only the declaration C<sub don't { 0 }> was valid, it
accepted the subroutine C<don't>, but the call C<print don't;> was
invalid, it was looking for a second single-quote string delimiter.
Note that in cperl since 5.28c C<'> is no perl4-style package seperator
anymore.

sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If you think it's a cperl specific bug or trust the cperl developers more 
please file an issue at L<https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues>.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
