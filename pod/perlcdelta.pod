=head1 NAME

perlcdelta - what is new for cperl v5.29.0

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the cperl 5.29.0 and the cperl
5.28.0 release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as v5.26.2c, first read
L<perl5280cdelta>, which describes differences between v5.26.2c and v5.28.0c.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here.  Summarize user-visible core language
enhancements.  Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 New warning shadow package

When a subroutine with the same name of a package exists, all package
methods are rerouted through this subroutine, effectively
eliminating all access to the package via methods.  This is almost
always an error, unless you want to override access to the package
or want a data-only package, without any methods.
cperl added the shadow warnings
L<perldiag/"Subroutine &%s::%s masks existing package %s::%s">
and L<perldiag/"Subroutine &%s masks new package %s">.
Use C<no warnings 'shadow';> to silence these new warnings.

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

XXX For a release on a stable branch, this section aspires to be:

    There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.XXX.XXX
    If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a
    report.  See L</Reporting Bugs> below.

[ List each incompatible change as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 Protected hash iterators

Iterating over a hash may now by default not change any key. Allow the
previous destructive behavior of changing a hash while iterating over
it with C<use hashiter;>
See L<[cperl #117]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/117>, cperl-only.

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.

=head2 Module removals

XXX Remove this section if inapplicable.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<"deprecated">-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

=item XXX

XXX Note that deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are listed
as an updated module in the L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

=head1 Performance Enhancements

XXX Changes which enhance performance without changing behaviour go here.
There may well be none in a stable release.

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>.  A paragraph summary
for important changes should then be added by hand.  In an ideal world,
dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be cribbed.

The list of new and updated modules is modified automatically as part of
preparing a Perl release, so the only reason to manually add entries here is if
you're summarising the important changes in the module update. (Also, if the
manually-added details don't match the automatically-generated ones, the
release manager will have to investigate the situation carefully.)

[ Within each section, list entries as an =item entry ]

=item L<attributes> 1.15c

Add ffi support, :native(), :encoded(), :nativeconv(), :symbol().

=item L<Cwd> 4.75c

Fixed long pathnames test for getcwd() on older systems, like debian-7.11 i386,
which still returns ENAMETOOLONG on large enough buffers.
Fix the HAS_GET_CURRENT_DIR_NAME check, and the is_ENAMETOOLONG macro.

=item L<Errno> 1.29_01

Protect from including some avx512 intrinsics directly on mingw.

=item L<Opcode> 1.40_03c

Restrict the new op 'enterffi'.

=item L<Storable> 3.11_02

Enable >2GB AvFILL check on store_hook (64bit)
Too many references returned by STORABLE_freeze.

=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

=over 4

=item *

Fix C<valid_ident()> for 128-255 chars not to use isIDFIRST_A nor
isIDCONT_A, _A does not match them.  Fixes F<t/uni/method.t> for chars
like oslash

=item *

Fix C<newSVpvn_share> to store the HEK_WASUTF8 flag if downgraded.
Improve C<newSVpvn_share> to downgrade only once, not twice.

A shared string and a GV with chars in the range 128-255 are downgraded to
bytes without the UTF8 flag. Store at least the HEK_WASUTF8 flag then.

=item *

Check bless name under use strict names.

The second argument to bless, the new classname, is now checked to be a
valid package name identifier when B<strict names> is in effect, and the
name is now normalized.
L<[cperl #376]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/376>

=item *

Fix cperl 5.28.0c regression disallowing calling subnames with a quote
in a package qualifier position.
L<[cperl #371]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/371>

This is now valid again:

  sub don't { 0 } print don't;

With v5.28.0c only the declaration C<sub don't { 0 }> was valid, it
accepted the subroutine C<don't>, but the call C<print don't;> was
invalid, it was looking for a second single-quote string delimiter.
Note that in cperl since 5.28c C<'> is no perl4-style package seperator
anymore.

=head1 Known Problems

XXX Descriptions of platform agnostic bugs we know we can't fix go here.  Any

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at L<https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<cperlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If you think it's a cperl specific bug or trust the cperl developers more 
please file an issue at L<https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues>.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
For details of how to report the issue.
