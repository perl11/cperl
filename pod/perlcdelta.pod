=head1 NAME

perlcdelta - what is new for cperl v5.27.1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes the differences between the cperl 5.27.0
and the cperl 5.27.1 releases.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as v5.24.2c, first
read the L<perl525*cdelta> documentation, which describes differences
between v5.25.1c and v5.26.0c

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here.  Summarize user-visible core language
enhancements.  Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 Check and normalize stringified names

Before symbols and identifiers created from strings at run-time were
added asis. Now those names are treated almost as in the parser at
compile-time, i.e. unicode is normalized, mixed Unicode scripts are
checked at run-time also. cperl-only.

Behaviour of L<perlapi/valid_ident>:

    ${"\xc3\x28"}       => FALSE.  Illegal unicode, but no warning or error,
                           unless under strict names.
    ${"E\x{45}\x{301}"} => TRUE.   Normalized to $E\x{c9}
    ${"एxṰர::ʦፖㄡsȨ"}   => FALSE. Error: Invalid script Tamil in identifier
                            ர::ʦፖㄡsȨ for U+0BB0. Have Devanagari

See below L</strict names>. C<use strict> fatalizes now any run-time
identifier parsing problem.

=head2 strict names

strict names is the default when using C<use strict>.  Reject illegal
identifiers at run-time when created dynamically from strings, which
would be rejected at compile-time. cperl-only.

    use strict "names";
    ${"\$var"}    => Invalid identifier "$var" while "strict names"
    ${"\xff"}     => Invalid identifier "\377" while "strict names"
    ${"\xc3\x28"} => Invalid identifier "\303(" while "strict names"

See L<perldata/"Identifier parsing"> and
L<http://perl11.org/blog/strict-names.html>

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

XXX For a release on a stable branch, this section aspires to be:

    There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.XXX.XXX
    If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a
    report.  See L</Reporting Bugs> below.

[ List each incompatible change as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.

=head2 Module removals

XXX Remove this section if inapplicable.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<"deprecated">-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

XXX Note that deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are listed
as an updated module in the L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

=head1 Performance Enhancements

=over 4

=item *

XS calls were made faster again. Previously cperl (with 5.22.1c) fell
from pure perl calls to XS calls and changed the call type to
ENTERXSSUB for faster subsequent invocations. This made bigger
examples ~10% faster.  Now the compiler detects calls to XS code and
changes the type to ENTERXSSUB.  Also the method cache code checks now
for an XS call and changes the type of the next OP. Overall the
improvement is ~3.5%, but it depends on the frequency of XS
calls. It's 0.5-1% slower without any XS call.  Note that p5p decided
to delete this feature request from it's TODO list.

The optree is a bit slimmer.
Before:

    $ cperl5.27.0d-nt -Dt -e'use strict'
    (-e:1)	nextstate
    (-e:1)	const(PV("strict.pm"))
    (-e:1)	require
    (-e:1)	nextstate
    (-e:1)	pushmark
    (-e:1)	const(PV("strict"))
    (-e:1)	method_named(->import)
    (-e:1)	entersub(strict::import)
    (-e:1)	enterxssub(strict::import)
    (-e:1)	leavesub

Now:

    $ cperl5.27.1d-nt -Dt -e'use strict'
    (-e:1)	nextstate
    (-e:1)	const(PV("strict.pm"))
    (-e:1)	require
    (-e:1)	nextstate
    (-e:1)	pushmark
    (-e:1)	const(PV("strict"))
    (-e:1)	method_named(->import)
    (-e:1)	enterxssub(strict::import)
    (-e:1)	leavesub

Note that this is still not optimal, as strict::import can be
compile-time optimized from a dynamic method call to a static function
call. A regression from 5.22.1c.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
L<https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<cperlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If you think it's a cperl specific bug or trust the cperl developers more 
please file an issue at L<https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues>.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
For details of how to report the issue.
