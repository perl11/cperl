'c' modules are accepted by cperl, but not by perl5. non-'c' modules are accepted by cperl and perl5.\n\nversion already accepts a final 'c'. currently only detectable in the `original` hash key.\nNow also add 'c' support to the CPAN prereq checks.\n\nAdd a permitted c suffix to version in CPAN::Meta::Spec and CPAN::Meta::Requirements.\nIt's okay when perl5 does not adopt this, as those two plus version are shipped with cperl core.\n\nrequirements for c versions are currently only satisfied by cperl. (signatures and types)\ncperl accepts versions with and without c, and should not warn about not existing, builtin modules (XSLoader, DynaLoader, strict, attributes) or unparsable versions. \nversion, EUMM and CPAN was already fixed, but improve version more","files":null}]}
