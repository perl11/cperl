=head1 NAME

perlcdelta - what is new for cperl v5.27.3

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the cperl 5.27.2 and the cperl
5.27.3 release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as v5.27.1c, first read
L<perl5272cdelta>, which describes differences between v5.27.1c and v5.27.2c.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here.  Summarize user-visible core language
enhancements.  Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 Disallow illegal glob with embedded NUL

E.g. C<< <$fh\000> >> throws now the safe syscalls warning, and errors
with C<Glob not terminated>, and does not pass the illegal glob path
to the internal or external glob.

This problem was added with v5.27.5 by replacing strchr with memchr,
allowing such illegal strings.
See L<[cperl #342]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/342>

=head1 Incompatible Changes

=head2 Illegal NUL, syntax error

Embedded NUL bytes read from files, not used in filters, are not
whitespace anymore, they are syntax errors.

See L<[cperl #345]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/345> vs
L<[perl #105920]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=105920>.

Parsing NUL bytes is now consistent from files with eval string.
C<\0> delimited C<q> quote is still valid though.

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.

=head2 Module removals

XXX Remove this section if inapplicable.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<"deprecated">-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

=item XXX

XXX Note that deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are listed
as an updated module in the L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

=item *

All static method calls are now optimized to function calls at compile-time.

Before:

    $ cperl5.27.0d-nt -Dt -e'use strict'
    (-e:1)	nextstate
    (-e:1)	const(PV("strict.pm"))
    (-e:1)	require
    (-e:1)	nextstate
    (-e:1)	pushmark
    (-e:1)	const(PV("strict"))
    (-e:1)	method_named(->import)
    (-e:1)	entersub(strict::import)
    (-e:1)	enterxssub(strict::import)
    (-e:1)	leavesub

v5.27.1c:

    $ cperl5.27.1d-nt -Dt -e'use strict'
    (-e:1)	nextstate
    (-e:1)	const(PV("strict.pm"))
    (-e:1)	require
    (-e:1)	nextstate
    (-e:1)	pushmark
    (-e:1)	const(PV("strict"))
    (-e:1)	method_named(->import)
    (-e:1)	enterxssub(strict::import)
    (-e:1)	leavesub

v5.27.2c:

    $ cperl5.27.2d-nt -Dt -e'use strict'
    (-e:1)	nextstate
    (-e:1)	const(PV("strict.pm"))
    (-e:1)	require
    (-e:1)	nextstate
    (-e:1)	pushmark
    (-e:1)	const(PV("strict"))
    (-e:1)	gv(strict::import)
    (-e:1)	enterxssub(strict::import)
    (-e:1)	leavesub

See L<http://blogs.perl.org/users/rurban/2011/06/how-perl-calls-subs-and-methods.html>

We don't yet optimize typed scalars to a static call. We don't walk
the subtypes yet to find the method.

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>.  A paragraph summary
for important changes should then be added by hand.  In an ideal world,
dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be cribbed.

The list of new and updated modules is modified automatically as part of
preparing a Perl release, so the only reason to manually add entries here is if
you're summarising the important changes in the module update. (Also, if the
manually-added details don't match the automatically-generated ones, the
release manager will have to investigate the situation carefully.)

=item *

Fixed error message for illegal charnames, and avoid passing NUL into
the charnames lookup, which is a potential security threat.  E.g. on
"\N{TILDE\000}" report "Missing right brace on \\N\{\}" as before
with 5.27.2 and on "\N{TILDE\001}" report "Unknown charname 'TILDE\1'" and
not "Unknown charname 'TILDE'".  perl5.27.5 started reporting those
errors with "Unknown charname 'TILDE'" hiding all characters behind
the embedded NUL or any non-printable character.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at L<https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<cperlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If you think it's a cperl specific bug or trust the cperl developers more 
please file an issue at L<https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues>.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
For details of how to report the issue.
