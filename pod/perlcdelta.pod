=head1 NAME

perlcdelta - what is new for cperl v5.24.0

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes perl-only differences between the cperl 5.22.3
release and the cperl 5.24.0 release.

=head1 Core Enhancements

=over 4

=item * Keep the lexical topic feature

Undo the removal of lexical topic. We fixed that in 5.22.2c already, and
it is critically needed for given/when, smartmatch.

=item * Proper signatures

Support builtin and efficient signatures, with types and references (call-by-ref),
goto to a signatured function is now a true tail call, reusing the old padframe
variables, not using copies.

See L<perlsub/Signatures> and L<perlfunc/prototype>.

The C<prototype> function returns the parsed string of a declared
signature if no prototype attribute overrides it.

The C<@_> array inside a function body with a signature is empty. With
default parameters there's is currently no way to find out how many
actual arguments were provided, and how many were filled out with
defaults.
L<[cperl #7]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/7>
L<[cperl #134]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/134>

=item * Less experimental needed

Remove the previously required use experimental for
C<lexical_topic>, C<smartmatch>.
C<given>/C<when> is now standard cperl syntax.

Note that C<postderef> and C<autoderef> were removed by perl5.

=item * Improved fast arithmetic

The compile-time C<u_{add,subtract,multiply}> op variants for constant folding
have now proper overflowing behaviour, and are now also used with 32bit.
L<[cperl #2]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/2>

=item * keep CxFOREACHDEF removed with perl-5.24.0

API macro to check for a loop with default var (gv or pad C<$_>).
Added with 5.9.3 by Robin Houston when he added given/when.
Deleted with 5.24.0, without any deprecation or mention.

=item * 2 new OP members

C<op_rettype> was added and C<op_typechecked> taken from a spare bit.

=back

=head1 Core Enhancements from Perl5

Backported some fixes from p5p, merged with perl-5.24.0.
L<[cperl #137]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/137>

=over 4

=item * ~20% performance improvements with a CX context system rewrite

=item * DESTROY cache moved back from the stash to mro_meta

So we don't need our special B::SvSTASH fixes anymore.

=back

=head1 Security

=head2 DynaLoader format string hardening

Replace all C<%> characters in user-controlled library filenames, passed via
the system dl_error call verbatim to C<printf>, without any arguments on the stack,
which could lead to execution of arbitrary stack code. No CVE.
This affects all systems with dynamic loading where the attacker can cause a
dynamic loading error.

CVSSv2 Severity: 7.2 (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:U/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:MH/TD:H/CR:H/IR:H/AR:ND)

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

=head2 Updated Modules and Pragmata

Many internal core modules are now properly "modernized", i.e.
use typed signatures, and catch errors at compile-time.
L<[cperl #97]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/97>

=over 4

=item Socket 2.021_02

Silence some CC warnings

Fix my to our $XS_VERSION

but this does not work with fake_signatures.
Expand the compile-time state of Test::Base to avoid
source filters.
Also add . to @INC in some tests

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated
from version control history including the perl and cperl repos. In particular,
it does not include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
reported issues to the Perl bug tracker and the cperl github issues.

Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules
included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for
helping Perl to flourish.

For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please see
the F<AUTHORS> file in the Perl source distribution.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
L<https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the C<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to C<perlbug@perl.org> to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If you think it's a cperl specific bug or trust the cperl developers more 
please file an issue at L<https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues>.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
to C<perl5-security-report@perl.org>.  This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the p5p core committers, who will be
able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
CPAN.

If you trust the cperl developers more, please send an email to
them. The p5p security teams skips many security issues, or are
unwilling to fix them.
