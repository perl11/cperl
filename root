It will check for valid identifiers being created from strings under no strict 'refs'. Which helps in fighting invalid identifiers\nbeing created, which cannot be handled by the rest of perl, and esp. since 5.16 with additional embedded NUL.  cperl 5.26 made embedded NUL's and invalid unicode identifiers [illegal](https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/233), and [normalizes unicode identifiers](https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/228). But there's still room left to create invalid, unnormalized and potentially harmful unicode names at run-time. Some cases are only warned against.  strict names will ensure no illegal name will get created.\n\nIt clashes with a reserved VMS hint. Means on VMS strict names will be a no-op, or implemented via a slow hint hash, not a fast hint bit.\n\nNote that p5p insists that illegal identifiers are still legal to create at run-time. Only compile-time illegal identifiers are illegal.\n\nSee also http://perl11.org/blog/strict-names.html","files":null}]}
