=head1 NAME

YAML::XS - Perl YAML Serialization using XS and libyaml

=for html

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use YAML::XS;

    my $yaml = Dump [ 1..4 ];
    my $array = Load $yaml;

    my $yaml = DumpFile ("my.yml", [ 1..4 ]);
    my $array = LoadFile "my.yml";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Kirill Siminov's C<libyaml> is a good YAML library implementation. The
C library is written precisely to the YAML 1.1 specification, and
offers YAML 1.2 support. It was originally bound to Python and was
later bound to Ruby. libsyck is written more elegant, has less bugs,
is not as strict as libyaml, but misses some YAML features. It can only
do YAML 1.1

This module is a Perl XS binding to libyaml which offers Perl somewhat
acceptable YAML support to date.

This module exports the functions C<Dump>, C<Load>, C<DumpFile> and
C<LoadFile>. These functions are intended to work exactly like C<YAML.pm>'s
corresponding functions.

If you set the option C<$YAML::XS::IndentlessMap> to 0 or undef,
C<YAML::XS> will behave like with version E<lt> 0.70, which creates yml
files which cannot be read by C<YAML.pm>

However the loader is stricter than C<YAML>, C<YAML::Syck> and
C<CPAN::Meta::YAML> i.e. C<YAML::Tiny> as used in core.  Set the
variable C<$YAML::XS::NonStrict> to allow certain reader errors to
pass the C<CPAN::Meta> validation testsuite.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

=head2 Loader Options

via globals variables only, so far. Affecting Load and LoadFile.

=over

=item C<$YAML::XS::NonStrict>

Permit certain reader errors to loosely match other YAML module
semantics.  In detail: Allow B<"control characters are not allowed">.
Note that any error is stored and returned, just not immediately.

However the reader error B<"invalid trailing UTF-8 octet"> and all other utf8
strictness violations are still fatal.

And if the structure of the YAML document cannot be parsed, i.e. a
required value consists only of invalid control characters, the loader
returns an error, unlike with non-strict YAML modules.

=item C<$YAML::XS::LoadCode>

Ignored.
If enabled supports deparsing and evaling of code blocks.

=back

=head2 Dumper Options

via globals variables only, so far. Affecting Dump and DumpFile

=over

=item C<$YAML::XS::UseCode>

If enabled supports Dump of CV code blocks via C<YAML::XS::coderef2text()>.

=item C<$YAML::XS::DumpCode>

If enabled supports Dump of CV code blocks via C<YAML::XS::coderef2text()>.

=item C<$YAML::XS::QuoteNumericStrings>

When true (the default) strings that look like numbers but have not been
numified will be quoted when dumping.

This ensures leading that things like leading zeros and other formatting are
preserved.

=item C<$YAML::XS::IndentlessMap>

Default 0

Set to 1 or a true value to fallback to the old C<YAML::XS> behavior to
omit the indentation of map keys, which arguably violates the YAML
spec, is different to all other YAML libraries and causes C<YAML.pm> to
fail.

With 0

     - this author

With 1

=item C<$YAML::XS::Indent>

Default 2

=item C<$YAML::XS::BestWidth>

Default 80

Control text wrapping.

=item C<$YAML::XS::Canonical>

Default 1

Set to undef or 0 to disable sorting map keys.

=item C<$YAML::XS::Unicode>

Default 1

Set to undef or 0 to disallow unescaped non-ASCII characters.

=item C<$YAML::XS::Encoding>

Default utf8

Set to any, utf8, utf16le or utf16be

=item C<$YAML::XS::LineBreak>

Default ln

Set to any, cr, ln or crln.

=item C<$YAML::XS::OpenEnded>

Default 0

Set to 1 or a true value to embed the yaml into "...".

=back

=head1 USING YAML::XS WITH UNICODE

Handling unicode properly in Perl can be a pain. YAML::XS only deals with
streams of utf8 octets. Just remember this:

    $perl = Load($utf8_octets);
    $utf8_octets = Dump($perl);

There are many, many places where things can go wrong with unicode. If you are
having problems, use Devel::Peek on all the possible data points.
