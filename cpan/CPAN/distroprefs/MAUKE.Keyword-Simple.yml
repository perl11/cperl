  Additionally, this distroprefs file is an illustration how to deal
  with allow_installing_outdated_dists when the goal of the goto is
  to install an outdated dist.

match:
  distribution: "^MAUKE/Keyword-Simple-0.04.tar.gz"
goto: "MAUKE/Keyword-Simple-0.03.tar.gz"
---
match:
  distribution: "^MAUKE/Keyword-Simple-0.03.tar.gz"
cpanconfig:
  allow_installing_outdated_dists: yes
