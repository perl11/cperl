First only for 32bit, but with the 32bit fixes (with 60d0c28) now also for 64bit.\n\nI'm not sure how severe that is. I doubt if our faster path should be made slower to warn on overflows, and also if there's no imprecision at all in this range of small doubles. double's have a big range of precise arithmetic and we don't want to check real mantissa overflow.","files":null}]}
