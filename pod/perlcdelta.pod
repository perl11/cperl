=head1 NAME

perlcdelta - what is new for cperl v5.28.1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes the differences between the cperl 5.28.0
and the cperl 5.28.1 releases.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as v5.26.0c, first
read the L<perl526*cdelta> documentation, which describes differences
between v5.26.0c and v5.26.3c

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

=head2 Check bless name under use strict names

The second argument to bless, the new classname, is now checked to be a
valid package name identifier when B<strict names> is in effect, and the
name is now normalized.
L<[cperl #376]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/376>

This is a bugfix, but a major compatibility change.

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Performance Enhancements

=over 4

=item Improve newSVpvn_share

Don't downgrade twice, the is_utf8 flags can be taken from the
returned hek, which does the downgrading to bytes already.

=back

=head1 Deprecations

=head2 Undeprecate "Unescaped left brace in regex" warnings and errors

In cperl only the following special unicode groups within regexes are reserved:

   Name:     \N{
   Property: \p{ \P{
   Break:    \b{ \B{
   Code:     \x{ \o{
   Group:    \g{

All other C</{}/> sequences are allowed in cperl and not deprecated
anymore. There's no need to quote the literal C<\{> and C<\}>, only if
it's ambiguous and can be mixed up with those reserved unicode groups.

B<automake> and more widespread utils does not need to be plagued by
spurious "Unescaped left brace in regex" warnings, when they dont need
to be quoted.  We undeprecated those new warnings and errors, there's
nothing more to reserve (yet).

=head2 Updated Modules and Pragmata

=over 4

=item C<Cwd> 4.75c

Fixed long pathnames test for getcwd() on older systems, like debian-7.11 i386,
which still returns ENAMETOOLONG on large enough buffers.
Fix the HAS_GET_CURRENT_DIR_NAME check, and the is_ENAMETOOLONG macro.

=item L<Errno> 1.29_01

Protect from including some avx512 intrinsics directly on mingw.

=item L<File::Path> 3.16_01c

Fix method of generating names for dummy users and groups during testing
(i.e. under docker)
L<[cpan #121967]|https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121967>.

=item L<Storable> 3.12_02

Enable >2GB AvFILL check on store_hook (64bit)
Too many references returned by STORABLE_freeze.
It wrapped around previously. Fixes Coverity CID #187854.
Move __Storable__.pm into Storable_pm.PL

=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

=over 4

=item *

Fix C<valid_ident()> for 128-255 chars not to use isIDFIRST_A nor
isIDCONT_A, _A does not match them.  Fixes F<t/uni/method.t> for chars
like oslash.

=item *

Fix C<newSVpvn_share> to store the HEK_WASUTF8 flag if downgraded.
Improve C<newSVpvn_share> to downgrade only once, not twice.

A shared string and a GV with chars in the range 128-255 are downgraded to
bytes without the UTF8 flag. Store at least the HEK_WASUTF8 flag then.

=item *

Check bless name under use strict names.

The second argument to bless, the new classname, is now checked to be a
valid package name identifier when B<strict names> is in effect, and the
name is now normalized.
L<[cperl #376]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/376>

=item *

Fix cperl 5.28.0c regression disallowing calling subnames with a quote
in a package qualifier position.
L<[cperl #371]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/371>

This is now valid again:

  sub don't { 0 } print don't;

With v5.28.0c only the declaration C<sub don't { 0 }> was valid, it
accepted the subroutine C<don't>, but the call C<print don't;> was
invalid, it was looking for a second single-quote string delimiter.
Note that in cperl since 5.28c C<'> is no perl4-style package seperator
anymore.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
L<https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<cperlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If you think it's a cperl specific bug or trust the cperl developers more 
please file an issue at L<https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues>.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
For details of how to report the issue.
