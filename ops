The CV itself is stored in the lexical pad of makeAddr though still.\n\nSee also http://www.erights.org/elib/capability/ode/ode-objects.html","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"04135dc995e2fdcd322aaf4268dbf04630a3cc7c"},"timestamp":1540543026,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE5MjgyMzI3MDg="},"added":["enhancement"],"removed":[]}]}
