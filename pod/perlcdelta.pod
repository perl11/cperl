=head1 NAME

perlcdelta - what is new for cperl v5.25.2

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes the differences between the cperl 5.25.1
and the cperl 5.25.2 development releases.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here.  Summarize user-visible core language
enhancements.  Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Security

=head2 use utf8 'Script'

In order to avoid TR39 confusable security hacks, we add the following
unicode rules for identifiers and literals:

=over

=item *

The 'Common' and 'Latin' scripts are always allowed and don't need to
be declared.

=item *

The first non-Latin and not-Common unicode script for an identifier is
the only allowed one. Others lead to parsers errors.

=item *

Additional unicode scripts can and should be declared via B<use utf8
'Greek', 'script-name2'...>. This allows mixed scripts in
identifiers. This can be scoped in blocks.

=back

See L<http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr39/#Mixed_Script_Detection> and
L<[cperl #229]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/229>

This holds for all identifiers (all names: package, gv, sub,
variables) and literal numbers.

Currently there exist 131 scripts, see L<utf8/"Valid scripts">.

=head2 hash seed exposure

cperl5.22.2 added a restraint to expose the internal hash secret seed
via the environment variable PERL_HASH_SEED_DEBUG=1 to be hidden in taint mode.
See L<[cperl #114]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/114>
and L<perl5222cdelta/Core Enhancements>.

    PERL_HASH_SEED_DEBUG=1 cperl5.22.2 -e1 =>
    HASH_FUNCTION = FNV1A HASH_SEED = 0xecfb00eb PERTURB_KEYS = 0 (TOP)

    PERL_HASH_SEED_DEBUG=1 cperl5.22.2 -t -e1 => empty

But unfortunately not many perl services are actually protected with
C<-t>, even if cperl fixed taint mode to be actually secure. The
seed exposure is only needed for a debugging perl, and actually is
security relevant.

So PERL_HASH_SEED_DEBUG=1 will now hide the seed value in
non-DEBUGGING builds.

    PERL_HASH_SEED_DEBUG=1 cperl5.25.2 -e1 =>
    HASH_FUNCTION = FNV1A HASH_SEED = <hidden> PERTURB_KEYS = 0 (TOP)

Note that the seed is still trivially exposable via other means if a
local script can be executed, as the seed value is readable from a
fixed offset to the first argument of every OP, at my_perl via unpack
"P". That's why cperl fixed hash table security via proper means in
the collision resolution, not via a slow hash function, and not via
order hiding as perl5 believes in.

More discussion at L<https://github.com/google/highwayhash/issues/28> and
L<https://github.com/google/highwayhash/issues/29>.

=head2 chdir heap-buffer-overflow

Fixed heap-buffer-overflow in chdir without argument. make chdir allocate the stack
it needs for the result, overwriting one stack entry. Note that the perl stack is on
the heap, so it's not that dramatic.

=head1 Incompatible Changes

XXX For a release on a stable branch, this section aspires to be:

    There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.XXX.XXX
    If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a
    report.  See L</Reporting Bugs> below.

[ List each incompatible change as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Deprecations

=head2 do_open, do_close macros

Those macros clash on darwin XTools with the system iostream
C<_OutputIterator> methods. We need to use the fullname
B<Perl_do_open> and B<Perl_do_close> functions whenever perl needs to be
embedded into C++ projects.

With the system C++ compiler on darwin C<do_open>, C<do_close> are now
undefined.  See L<[cperl #227]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/227>

=head2 Removed ' as package seperator

Make something like C<sub foo'bar;> a syntax error.
C<'> is not replaced by C<::> anymore when used as package seperator.
This was deprecated 10 years ago.

cperl fixed the L</c2ph> core utility using this last remaining perl4'ism,
and removed the C<isn't> method from L<Test::More>.

See L<[cperl #217]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/217>.

=head2 Module removals

XXX Remove this section if inapplicable.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<"deprecated">-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

=over

=item XXX

XXX Note that deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are listed
as an updated module in the L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

=back

[ List each other deprecation as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Performance Enhancements

=over 4

=item *

Most NULL ops are now removed in the peephole optimizer. Check for
C<#if defined(PERL_REMOVE_OP_NULL)> in your XS module if you hardcoded
any NULL-sensitive op-tree structure. See how many with C<-Dk>.

=item *

C<-DPERL_FAKE_SIGNATURE> is now default, making most function calls 2x faster.
See L</fake_signatures>

=back

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>.  A paragraph summary
for important changes should then be added by hand.  In an ideal world,
dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be cribbed.

[ Within each section, list entries as a =item entry ]

=head1 Configuration and Compilation

=over 4

=item arflags

Probe for arflags, which do support C<D> for deterministic static archives
without member timestamps. On darwin we currently only have F<llvm-ar-mp-3.9>
(since 3.7) which does support this.

ranlib is probed for the C<-D> flag for reproducible build determinism.

=item fixed longdblinfbytes probe

With Intel long double it didn't clean random excess garbage bytes
after the 10th byte.

=item cperl build helper scripts

Added the following release scripts to F<Porting:> F<do-conf-clean>
F<do-conf-cperl-release> F<do-make-cperl-release>
F<do-make-srctarball> F<perl_version> for Linux (debian and rpm) and
Darwin.

Those builds are now reproducible, see below.

=item reproducible builds

cperl has now support for automatic reproducible builds on most platforms.
A new B<cf_epoch> config key was added.

The config key B<cf_time> is now based on: 1. SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH,
2. with .git the newest file in the repository, or 3. the newest file
in the MANIFEST.

Builds are done with C<LC_ALL=C> and C<PERL_HASH_SEED=0>, but builds are still
LANGUAGE or compiler specific.

Those builds are reproducible when done on the same machine and user.
Otherwise set the keys: cf_by, cf_email, mydomain, myhostname, myuname also.

See L<[cperl #169]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/169>.

=item passcat

This suspicious Config key was removed from cperl.
If you have a NIS database use C<ypcat passwd>.
passcat is not used in any public CPAN module.

=item fake_signatures

Ask for L<fake_signatures> being compiled in as default or not.
Defaults to yes with cperl, no without. Sets C<$Config{fake_signatures}>
and defines C<PERL_FAKE_SIGNATURE>.

=item d_llabs

Probe for C<llabs()> needed for PERL_IABS on 32bit with -Duse64bitint,
the default on mingw/cygwin. Defines C<HAS_LLABS>.

=item d_setenv

Probe for C<setenv()> needed on some platforms with strict linkage or
C<-fvisibility=hidden>.

=item d_attribute_always_inline

Probe for C<__attribute__((always_inline))>, which is helpful with
C<clang -flto=thin> for exported mathoms (b) and inlined functions.

The problem is that  C<__attribute__((used))> functions are not inlined.
With always_inline + global visibility, but not C<__attribute__((used))>
we get inlined variants plus exported copies for the API.
Add C<PERL_MATHOM_CALLCONV> to use it.

=back

=head1 Testing

=over 4

=item *

Added F<t/porting/embedcpp.t> to check for perl.h C++ compatibility with a modern
C++ compiler. There must be no fatal compilation errors in the C<-c> step from
C++ incompatibilities in any perl header file.

Note that Microsoft Visual C++ still throws errors. You cannot use that yet.
See L<[cperl #227]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/227>.

This is related to the new C<-Wc++11-compat> and C<-fpermissive> fixes.

=head1 Internal Changes

=over 4

=item *

Support for clang C<-flto> and the new C<-flto=thin> optimization was
added, via C<__attribute__global__> for global visibility for all
exported API functions, even if not used, and C<-DLTO>. Note that is
not needed for C<gcc -flto>, and the clang variant produces slower code.

Rudimentary support for C<-fsanitize=cfi> was also added, which is
safer than the old C<-fstack-protector-strong>, but this is not yet
finished.

ExtUtils-ParseXS adds now a correct visibility declaration of
C<XS_EXTERNAL> for C<-flto> and C<-fvisibility=hidden>, which is needed for
C<-fsanitize=cfi> support.

=item *

Added many OP read-write field accessor macros, like C<OpFIRST>,
C<OpLAST>, C<OpOTHER>, C<OpKIDS>, C<OpSPECIAL>, C<OpSTACKED>,
C<OpDEREF>, C<OpWANT_VOID>, C<OpWANT_SCALAR>, C<OpWANT_LIST>.  And
shorter type checks: C<IS_TYPE>, C<ISNT_TYPE>, C<NO_OP_TYPE_OR_WASNT>.

rpeep uses now consistently the local C<o>, and not the global C<PL_op> variable.

=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

XXX Important bug fixes in the core language are summarized here.  Bug fixes in
files in F<ext/> and F<lib/> are best summarized in L</Modules and Pragmata>.

=over 4

=item *

Fixed the range unicode bug. When the right side of the range is a UTF-8 encoded
string, but the left side not, downgrade the right side to native octets.
E.g.

    my $r = chr 255; utf8::upgrade $r; my $num = ("a" .. $r);
    print $num

should print 26 but does 702, because the utf-8 repr. of C<\x{ff}>
is C<"\303\277" [UTF8 "\x{ff}"]>, and the range was incremented from
"a" to "\x{c3}\x{bf}" instead.
See L<[cperl #218]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/218>.

=item *

Fixed several issues with C<-Duseshrplib>, a shared F<libcperl.$so>:

install it (!!),
fix ExtUtils::Embed and B-C compilation and testing,
fix tests on darwin,
fix configuration probe of Term::ReadKey.

=item *

Fixed C<sv_dump> of fbm-magic strings which did previously contain the wrong
"VALID,EVALED" string for a flag which is either VALID or EVALED. cperl only.

=item *

Fixed a cperl-only failure in signatures with default blocks introducing
a new lexical variable. As in C<sub t151($a,$b=do{my $f},$c=1){} t151($x,$x,$x)>.
This failure was only fatal on 32bit + -Duse64bitint systems.

C<SIGNATURE_arg_default_op> does not have a items arg.
See L<[cperl #164]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/164>.
and L<[cperl #213]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/213>.

=item *

For open cperl problems see L<[issues]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/>.

Some of these fixes also can to be backported from perl5.25.x upstream.

=item *

The perl debugger doesn't yet work with signatures. It doesn't step into
such functions and it may fail.
See e.g. L<[cperl #167]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/167>

=item *

F<t/op/taint.t> contained a test with signatures and 6 default
arguments, which on some 32 bit systems led to random "Reference
parameter cannot take default value at op/taint.t line 2461"
compile-time failures. This test has been rewritten to ony use 4 arguments.

See L<[cperl #164]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/164>

=item *

C<clang -flto=thin> and on some systems even C<gcc -flto> with C<-O3>
or C<-finline> leads to invisible symbols which were inlined and not
exported, even if they should be declared as public API. Work is
ongoing in the F<feature/gh186-lto-thin> branch, but there the
inlining is disabled by the C<used> attribute, leading to a
10% performance regression.  On the other hand a working
C<clang-3.9 -flto> leads to 20% performance improvements.

=item *

C< until ($x = 1) { ... } > and C< ... until $x = 1 > should
warn when syntax warnings are enabled.
L<[perl #127333]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=127333>
