This is of course asking for trouble.\nMake sure -Dflag is not overriding critical hints flags (but leave it open to override wrong hints flags?)\n\nSomeone came up with the wrong idea that `__APPLE__` is not widely/officially supported. It is. Together with `__MACH__` it is `PERL_DARWIN`.\nAdd this logic to perl.h.","files":null}]}
