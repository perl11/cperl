Similar to C.\n\n```\nmy @array[] = (1..10);\nmy @array[] :const = (1,2,3,4);\n```\n\nIt's often cumbersome to count and maintain the shaped array count, and the compiler might count it easier.\nA computed shaped array without assignment is a syntax error: `my @array[];`\nMaximal recursion depth: 36","files":null}]}
