=head1 NAME

perlcdelta - what is new for cperl v5.22.5

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes perl-only differences between the cperl 5.22.4
release and the cperl 5.22.5 release.

For B<cperl> also see F<Changes> and L<perlcperl>

=head1 Security

=head2 C<@{ \327 \n }> buffer overflows

Fixed C<@{ \327 \n }> tokenizer failures and heap buffer overflows in
C<sv_vcatpvfn_flags()> with wrong tracking of C<PL_linestr>, the
currently parsed line buffer. This can easily lead to security
relevant exploits.

L<[perl #128951]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128951>

=head2 C<eval "q" . chr(overlarge)> stack overflow

In C<eval "q" . chr(100000000064)> generating the error message
C<Can't find string terminator "XXX"'> was overrunning a local buffer
designed to hold a single utf8 char, since it wasn't allowing for
the C<\0> at the end.

L<[perl #128952]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128952>

=head2 Set umask(0600) before calling mkstemp

POSIX 2008 demands such an umask, but it is still problematic on
Solaris, HP-UX and AIX and older libcs, e.g. glibc <= 2.06.
The old umask 0177 was insecure.

=head2 Disallow illegal glob with embedded NUL

E.g. C<< <$fh\000> >> throws now the safe syscalls warning, and errors
with C<Glob not terminated>, and does not pass the illegal glob path
to the internal or external glob.

See L<[cperl #342]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/342>

=head2 Follow chroot with chdir("/")

Fixed two security issues with the chroot op:

* fail on embedded NUL in the chroot argument.
Set C<errno> to EINVAL.

* If a call to chroot is not followed by a call to chdir("/") the
chroot jail confinement can be violated.  In Perl_pp_chroot: A call to
chroot followed by an operation that may escape from the chroot jail.
Coverity CID #165302 Insecure chroot.

=item *

F<t/porting/cmp_version.t> was fixed together with EUMM to handle
parsing versions from filehandles. Backported.

=head1 Internal Changes

Changes which affect the interface available to C<XS> code go here.  Other
significant internal changes for future core maintainers should be noted as
well.

=item *

SvREADONLY_off(sv) is only usable as statement, not as expression anymore.
It broke Sun C 5.12, in ByteLoader.

=item aelem_u: fix loop oob for padav

Out-of-bounds check elimination in loops has been fixed for lexical
counters.  E.g. with C<my @a=(0..4); for my $i (0..$#a) { $a[$i] }> each
access to C<$a[$i]> in the loop is now really converted to the
unchecked faster B<aelem_u> op.

Note that multideref ops are not yet converted to omit out-of-bounds
checks. This is only implemented since cperl-5.25, since it needs to
widen the internal mderef structure.

=item fixed -DH crash on clear

When clearing a hv (with refcnt 0), HvKEYS crashed with an
invalid mg on a placeholder. Just use HvTOTALKEYS instead.

=item Check for null in pp_ghostent et al.

Specifically in the C<S_space_join_names_mortal> static function that
several pp functions call.  On some platforms (such as Gentoo Linux
with torsocks), C<< hent->h_aliases >> (where C<hent> is a C<struct hostent *>) may
be null after a C<gethostent> call.

L<[perl #128740]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128740>

=item DynaLoader::dl_find_symbol_anywhere

Fixed return type of C<DynaLoader::dl_find_symbol_anywhere()>,
the address, not the name.
L<[cperl #352]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/352>.

=head1 Acknowledgements

cperl 5.22.5 represents approximately 2 months of development since cperl 5.22.4
and contains approximately 900,000 lines of changes across 570 files from 13
authors.

Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there were
approximately 7,900 lines of changes to 120 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.

The following people are known to have contributed the improvements
that became cperl 5.22.5:

Reini Urban, Father Chrysostomos, Karl Williamson, David Mitchell, Daniel
Dragan, Tony Cook, Lukas Mai, Niko Tyni, H.Merijn Brand, Hugo van der Sanden,
Dagfinn Ilmari Mannsåker, Aaron Crane, Dan Collins.

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated
from version control history. In particular, it does not include the names of
the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl bug
tracker.

Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules
included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for
helping Perl to flourish.

For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please see
the F<AUTHORS> file in the Perl source distribution.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
https://rt.perl.org/ .  There may also be information at
http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the F<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If you think it's a cperl specific bug or trust the cperl developers more 
please file an issue at L<https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues>.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
to perl5-security-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be
able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
CPAN.

If you trust the cperl developers more, please send an email to
them. The p5p security teams skips many security issues, or are
unwilling to fix them.
