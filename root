This is fixed and cannot be changed\n# TYPE_DEFERRED: if the type was deferred by the compiler. This is also fixed, but has weaker guarantees\n# TYPE_HINT: if the type was optionally observed/guessed by the compiler or run-time. such as array\u003cint\u003e which can be broken by any change. This can be taken away, leading to generalized code.","files":null}]}
