  This instruction is only shown on older perl below 5.7 or something

  We need to set the timeout high because DBI wants to tell us
  something and sleeps between paragraphs:

  % grep sleep Makefile.PL
      sleep 4;                                         
      sleep 4;
      sleep 1;
      sleep 1;

  For the patch visit https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=59840

match:
  distribution: 'TIMB/DBI-1.613.tar.gz'
pl:
  eexpect:
    mode: anyorder
    timeout: 20
    talk:
      - 'Press return to continue\.\.\.'
      - "\n"
