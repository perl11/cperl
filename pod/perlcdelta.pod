=head1 NAME

perlcdelta - what is new for cperl v5.27.0

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes the differences between the cperl 5.26.0
and the cperl 5.27.0 releases.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as v5.24.2c, first
read the L<perl525*cdelta> documentation, which describes differences
between v5.25.1c and v5.26.0c

=head1 Core Enhancements

=head2 study HASH CODE ARRAY

study does not stringify hashes anymore, it rather calls the new
L<hv_study|perlapi/hv_study> function on hashes, which optimizes the
internal structure of a hash.  Currently clears all placeholders, and
optionally shrinks its size if the new size falls below a power of
two.  On code, regex and arrays it does nothing yet, but might add type
optimizations on the current dynamic status.

=head2 New strict hashpairs

Added C<use strict 'hashpairs'> to allow only pairs for hash assignments,
within a map even only an empty or single pair.
See L<[cperl #281|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/281>.

=head2 Honor the BOM

With any of three supported BOMs set C<use utf8> and C<use feature
'unicode_strings'> at compile-time as documented until perl 5.26.

With 5.26 perl5 decided to change the documentation to match the
broken implementation.
With cperl 5.27.0c the implementation was fixed instead.
See L<[cperl #269]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/269>
and L<[perl #121292]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=121292>.

=head2 Safer perl -c:s cmdline flag

Avoid undoable and unsafe sideeffects (io, ...) in the CHECK mode,
esp. for editor syntax checks.
See L<[cperl #263]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/263>

Essentially prepend C<-Mops=:browse,:load,print> with C<-c:s>.

=head1 Incompatible Changes

=head3 use strict hashpairs

With C<use strict> this will now fail:

  my %xsc = map { /(.*)\.xs$/ ? ("$1.c" => 1, "$1.cc" => 1) : () } @files;

Two pairs being added in a map block violates strict hashpairs.
Add the second pair in a second loop or C<no strict 'hashpairs'>.

  my %xsc = map { /(.*)\.xs$/ && ("$1.c" => 1) } @files;
  /^(.*)\.xs$/) && $xsc{"$1.cc"} = 1 for @files;

=head1 Performance Enhancements

=over 4

=item *

On hash split and shrink the rounding up to a power of 2 has been
improved by a factor of 10^8 on modern hardware. On old hardware by a
factor of 2.

=item *

Replaced the old quadratic bsd glob with a linear glob, detected by
Russ Cox L<https://research.swtch.com/glob>.

Support for long paths have been added to all platforms, for C<cwd>

Use for C<getcwd(NULL)> or C<get_current_dir_name()>,
which can return paths longer than 4096.

=item darwin

Fixed hints for pgcc

=item MSWin32

More mingw build improvements, but the smoker still not pass the
tests, and my local vm seems to be broken.

Fixed invalid check_type_and_open macro on mingw miniperl.

Cygwin and the MSVC versions 10,12,14 smoke now ok with 32-bit and 64-bit.

Fixed upstream mkstemp API changes.

getcwd is deprecated on Windows. use _getcwd() instead.

PathTools: Support overlong paths for getdcwd(), using the wide API for overlong paths.

Added study API functions for possible internal costly optimizations
of hv, av, cv, and rx, such as hash shrinking, regex and cv jit
compilation, and av type promotion.  For now implemented is
C<hv_study()>, the rest are stubs.
