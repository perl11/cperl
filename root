A couple of files need small fixes.\n\nList of all steps:\n\n* download cperl-5.30.0.tar.gz from github\n* perlbrew install /path/to/cperl-5.30.0.tar.gz as cperl-5.30.0 \u0026\n* just as the build starts you can easily \"patch\" the files for the running build\n* cd ~/perl5/perlbrew/build/cperl-5.30.0/cperl-5.30.0 and modify write_buildcustomize.pl in order to add dist/if to line 31 \n* comment out line 115 of installman (or else it will complain about a non-existant file handle. whatever, seems ok to ignore. maybe worth investigating at some point I suppose.)\n* yeah, you could make those changes to the files beforehand too, say, by untarring, editing, and retarring and gzipping. perlbrew seems to only take local tarballs instead of having an option for uncompressed local directories?\n* watch the scrolling output with tail -f ~/perl5/perlbrew/build.cperl-5.30.0.log\n\nDone!","files":null}]}
