There are no proper tests.\nMaybe add `Internals::DumpArenas` to core to execute more tests, much more than `Devel::Peek`.\n\nSome cases are going back to 5.6.\n\nSee https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=81635 \n- SvSTASH of %version:: is broken. see #60 and https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=107459\n  This is not dump related, it just crashes with invalid stashes, used as DESTROY cache. Fixed with GH #60. We need to check SvOBJECT before accessing SvSTASH.\n- SvTAIL is broken with PVMG with threads and debugging (an our padname), need to check `!SvSCREAM` before trying `SvTAIL`\n- CvANON is broken \u003c 5.8 for `PADBUSY | PADMY` CVs\n- CvGV for RV are broken, fix op_dump of `rv2cv gv`.
