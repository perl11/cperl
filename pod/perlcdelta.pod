=head1 NAME

perlcdelta - what is new for cperl v5.24.1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes perl-only differences between the cperl 5.24.0
release and the cperl 5.24.1 release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.22.3, first read
L<perl5240cdelta>, which describes differences between 5.22.3 and 5.24.0.

=head1 Notice

perl5.24.1 was security update to non-existing problem. cperl added
PERLIO_DEBUG as optional handle to redirect DEBUGGING outout via -Dx
switches to. This is only usable with DEBUGGING perls, which are not
used in production, only during development.
perl5.24.1 changed PERLIO_DEBUG to only be active for PerlIO debugging
together with -Di.

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Performance Enhancements

=over 4

=item *

Out-of-bounds check elimination in loops has been fixed for lexical
counters.  E.g. with C<my @a=(0..4); for my $i (0..$#a) { $a[$i] }> each
access to C<$a[$i]> in the loop is now really converted to the
unchecked faster B<aelem_u> op.

Note that multideref ops are not yet converted to omit out-of-bounds
checks. This is only implemented since cperl-5.25 (released with
5.26.0c), since it needs to widen the internal mderef structure.

=item *

The new C<strQEc>/C<strNEc> macros are used instead of
C<strEQ(s,"constant")>. This enables word-wise comparison via memcpy,
in opposite of byte-wise comparisons via strcmp with already known
sizes. This is a 10% performance improvement under most optimization
levels.

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>.  A paragraph summary
for important changes should then be added by hand.  In an ideal world,
dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be cribbed.

[ Within each section, list entries as a =item entry ]

=head2 Changes to Existing Documentation

=head1 Diagnostics

The following additions or changes have been made to diagnostic output,
including warnings and fatal error messages.  For the complete list of
diagnostic messages, see L<perldiag>.

=head2 New Diagnostics

=head3 New Errors

=over 4

=item *

The L<Too many elements|perldiag/"Too many elements"> error is now
triggered when accessing or extending an out of bounds array index or
trying to insert too many hash keys. This is to prevent from silent
hash or array overflows. Previously extending a hash beyond it's
capable size was silently ignored, leading to performance degradation
with overly high fill factors and extending an array failed only on
memory exhaustion, but the signed index led to an index overflow
between I32 and U32, resp.  I64 and U64.

=head1 Utility Changes

XXX Changes to installed programs such as F<cperlbug> and F<xsubpp> go here.
Most of these are built within the directory F<utils>.

=head1 Testing

XXX Any significant changes to the testing of a freshly built perl should be
listed here.  Changes which create B<new> files in F<t/> go here as do any
large changes to the testing harness (e.g. when parallel testing was added).
Changes to existing files in F<t/> aren't worth summarizing, although the bugs
that they represent may be covered elsewhere.

versions did not.  These will either be enabled by new files in the F<hints/>

=head1 Internal Changes

XXX Changes which affect the interface available to C<XS> code go here.  Other
significant internal changes for future core maintainers should be noted as
well.

=item *

Increasing the hash size to values larger then U32_MAX are now silently ignored.
This only affects 64-bit platforms. Normally a hash split to an overlarge value
should die, but historically it silently ignored the split, it just increases the
fill rate and decreases performance.

=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

XXX Important bug fixes in the core language are summarized here.  Bug fixes in
files in F<ext/> and F<lib/> are best summarized in L</Modules and Pragmata>.

[ List each fix as a =item entry ]

=over 4

=item *

Array and hash index overflow are now properly detected and throw an
"Too many elements" error.

E.g. on 32bit C<$ary[2147483648]> will lead to a compile-time error,
C<$i=2147483648; $ary[$i]> to a run-time error. Before 5.24c or with perl5
those two would silently overflow to C<-1>, i.e. accessing the last element.

When inserting more than U32, i.e. 4294967295 hash elements, the same
error is now thrown. Before 5.24c or with perl5 the element would have
been inserted, with 32bit the hash table would not have been extended
and the load factor would increase, the collisions and performance
would decrease.  On 64bit the hash table would have beed increased,
but the elements would collide on the last element, leading to the
same problems, just more dramatic.

=head1 Known Problems

XXX Descriptions of platform agnostic bugs we know we can't fix go here.  Any
tests that had to be C<TODO>ed for the release would be noted here.  Unfixed
platform specific bugs also go here.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
https://rt.perl.org/ .  There may also be information at
http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<cperlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
for details of how to report the issue.
