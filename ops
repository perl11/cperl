Which is the typical bootstrapping problem I wanted to avoid.\n\nIt even requires a full perl, not even a miniperl, due to the re.xs dependency, caused by Text::Wrap in regen/regen_lib.pl","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"04135dc995e2fdcd322aaf4268dbf04630a3cc7c"},"timestamp":1451130558,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NzMxODI1Nw==","github-url":"https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/99#issuecomment-167318257"},"message":"Fixed with 47c2e1d15c544bfb185e05efe7b5a719f1a03127\nBumped Config to 6.05_01","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"04135dc995e2fdcd322aaf4268dbf04630a3cc7c"},"timestamp":1451130558,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NTAwNzA3OTcz"},"status":2}]}
