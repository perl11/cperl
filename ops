Is fixing the crashes from these input files something you're interested in? The input files can be found here: https://github.com/rwhitworth/cperl-fuzz/tree/master/2017-06-05.  \n\nAdditionally there is a README.md within that repo directory that contains the gdb backtrace output.  The binary was compiled with `AFL_HARDEN=1` (an afl-clang-fast compiler variable) so there may be some extra information that would not normally be printed to the screen during program execution.\n\nThe files can be executed as `./perl id_filename` to cause seg faults and aborts.  These were generated from commit 45ac51b\n\nLet me know if I can provide any more information to help narrow down these issues.  If you would rather each of these issues be reported as separate issues I can do that as well.","files":null}]}
