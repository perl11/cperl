CORE::dump looks nicer though.\n\n* 01f9673fe8388317fdf7fca63774e3bc0dfd58d3 add S_process_optree() function to op.c\n\nWe rather added a split preprocess and postprocess_optree pair with 5.22. This simplier variant fails with Undefined subroutine \u0026main::BEGIN called.\nWe need the preprocess step to add optimization passes before rpeep is called, in our case for fake_signatures.\n\n* 2560602ccfb78a9b4743012af45eeb2e7b74e47e Remove utils/c2ph and utils/pstruct\n\nWe rather fixed it some time ago already.\n\n* 7cc9fe9f24f654e4295a82ca84e289a5160cf10c toke.c: Don't compare same bytes twice\n \nWrong advice. alignment is more important than single bytes.\n\n* 21921336d307f4b7bf907befab709a9d086d2d7a Test for [perl #130567]\n Wrong test reverted later.\n\n* b1a69a65ecd83426da7ca1af26b757fe0da58007 ckDEAD: PL_curcop-\u003ecop_warnings only if PL_curcop\n\nRather fix the empty curcop with it without run-time costs, as in lexwarn with 790e7f094a71387e0e271d0777e4f5c6ca535cf8","files":null}]}
