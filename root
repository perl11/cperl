No binary names at all, not just a new use strict 'names'.\n\nEven if I fixed most issues since 5.16 by myself, it's still a high security risk.\nAnd even the current p5p maintainer has no idea what this is about, as he showed in his YAPC::NA XS tutorial, happily forgetting about the gv len.\n\nTechnically this is different to the 2 other unicode security fixes. Not in the parser, but in the run-time: rv2sv\n\nWe don't even die on \\0 in syscall args, we just warn. At least in cperl this warning is default on. (in perl5 it is off, because they ignore security)\n\nSo what to do with symbols? \n1. Silently strip as before 5.16, \n2. let the \\0 and warn as with syscalls,\n3. strip the \\0 and die,\n4. strip the \\0 and warn (preferred - next minor version),\n5. as 3. and also change syscalls to die and not warn. (next major version)","files":null}]}
