=head1 NAME

perlcdelta - what is new for cperl v5.26.2

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes the differences between the cperl 5.26.1c
and the cperl 5.26.2c releases.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as v5.26.0c, first
read the L<perl5261cdelta> documentation, which describes differences
between v5.26.0c and v5.26.1c.

=head1 Security

=head2 Set umask(0600) before calling mkstemp

POSIX 2008 demands such an umask, but it is still problematic on
Solaris, HP-UX and AIX and older libcs, e.g. glibc <= 2.06.
The old umask 0177 was insecure.

=head2 Disallow illegal glob with embedded NUL

E.g. C<< <$fh\000> >> throws now the safe syscalls warning, and errors
with C<Glob not terminated>, and does not pass the illegal glob path
to the internal or external glob.

See L<[cperl #342]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/342>

=head2 Follow chroot with chdir("/")

Fixed two security issues with the chroot op:

* fail on embedded NUL in the chroot argument.
Set C<errno> to EINVAL.

* If a call to chroot is not followed by a call to chdir("/") the
chroot jail confinement can be violated.  In Perl_pp_chroot: A call to
chroot followed by an operation that may escape from the chroot jail.
Coverity CID #165302 Insecure chroot.

=head2 [CVE-2017-12837] Heap buffer overflow in regular expression compiler

Compiling certain regular expression patterns with the case-insensitive
modifier could cause a heap buffer overflow and crash perl.  This has now been
fixed.
L<[perl #131582]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131582>

=head2 [CVE-2017-12883] Buffer over-read in regular expression parser

For certain types of syntax error in a regular expression pattern, the error
message could either contain the contents of a random, possibly large, chunk of
memory, or could crash perl.  This has now been fixed.
L<[perl #131598]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131598>

=head2 [CVE-2017-12814] C<$ENV{$key}> stack buffer overflow on Windows

A possible stack buffer overflow in the C<%ENV> code on Windows has been fixed
by removing the buffer completely since it was superfluous anyway.

=item *

Fixed wrong C<panic: distributed hash flood> when dealing with
large C<%^H> hints hashes, with >127 entries, such as C<_charnames.pm> in
C<Regexp::Common>. Fixed the logic dealing with such a hints hash.
L<[cperl #350]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/350>.

=item *

Fixed endless rpeep compiler loop with a constant loop and a nested loop,
which e.g. broke C<Net:HTTP>.
L<[cperl #349]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/349>.

=item *

Fixed return type of C<DynaLoader::dl_find_symbol_anywhere()>,
the address, not the name.
L<[cperl #352]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/352>.

=item *

The code that vivifies a typeglob out of a code ref made some false assumptions
that could lead to a crash in cases such as C<< $::{"A"} = sub {}; \&{"A"} >>.
This has now been fixed.
L<[perl #131085]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131085>

=item *

Several built-in functions previously had bugs that could cause them to write
to the internal stack without allocating room for the item being written.  In
rare situations, this could have led to a crash.  These bugs have now been
fixed, and if any similar bugs are introduced in future, they will be detected
automatically in debugging builds.

C<my_atof2> no longer reads beyond the terminating NUL, which previously
occurred if the decimal point is immediately before the NUL.

Occasional "Malformed UTF-8 character" crashes in C<s//> on utf8 strings have
been fixed.
L<[perl #131575]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131575>

Some erroneous warnings after utf8 conversion have been fixed.
L<[perl #131190]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131190>

=item *

The C<jmpenv> frame to catch Perl exceptions is set up lazily, and this used to
be a bit too lazy.  The catcher is now set up earlier, preventing some possible
crashes.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
L<https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<cperlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If you think it's a cperl specific bug or trust the cperl developers more 
please file an issue at L<https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues>.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
For details of how to report the issue.
