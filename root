This properly supports 32bit/64bit, is much easier to install and guarantees compat. for bootstrapping just set CCHOME=C:\\MinGW\n* fix the Extensions dependency from PERLIMPLIB to PERLDLL which does now create the PERLIMPLIB.\n* fix the Extensions_normalize target. This overwrites the global Extension list","files":null}]}
