GvFILE should be enough though.\nThe only problems are: lexical subs, imported functions and anon subs.\n\nFor imports: they will have the wrong filename then, the one from the original definition, not the one where the import was done. This is not concern I think\nbulk88 came up with a really good patch, I will adopt, I think.","files":null}]}
