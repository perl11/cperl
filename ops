I will then convert most of the already modernized modules to use classes also, such as Test::Simple, Pod::Simple, bigint to use classes.\n* types: see above. The core modules who benefit most are already modernized to use signatures with types, and thus are 2x faster and safer. Each typed module has a \"c\" suffix, because perl5 cannot read typed signatures yet, only the old lexical declarations from 5.6 can use types.\n* perlcc is used to compile scripts, as before. If statically or dynamically depends on how libperl is defined, static or shared.\n* cpan/cpantesters: since upstream, both p5p and the toolchain gang, still boycott any cooperation it's hard. So far their argument was that I'm technically wrong, and they are right. This changed recently. The next argument was a religious one, that I don't express enough \"faith\" in the devs and thereby violated their code of conduct. Literally.\nTheir latest argumentation is that nobody wants to work with me, because I'm \"uncivil\". Which also a bogus argument, because they are the ones who are uncivil and I was the one who acted professionally.  It will eventually settle itself, once they'll notice that perl5 cannot be used anymore, and they'll have to switch to cperl and proper management. The destruction done is accelerating, security issues are piling up and the feature differences enhance greatly. Once cperl is 2x faster and better there's no p5p anymore.\nI don't even have a travis or appveyor smoking for recipe for myself yet.\n\n* how detect? this should be in `cperldoc perlcperl`.\n  How to detect cperl?\n    \"\"$^V\" =~ /c$/\"\n    config.h defines \u003cUSE_CPERL\u003e\n    Config.pm defines \"usecperl\"\n    cperl changed modules end with \"c\", typically \"_01c\".\n    Libraries are installed into /usr/local/lib/cperl, not\n    /usr/local/lib/perl5.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"590d2d81974d77b0e50cba3862217e283f147340"},"timestamp":1512316929,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0ODc4ODMzOQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/343#issuecomment-348788339"},"message":"Thank you for the detailed reply, @rurban !\nYes, I've read your blog.\nFrom all my heart I hope thinks will settle and there will be understanding and collaboration.\nIt is even hard to find job as a Perl programmer here in Central and Eastern Europe.
