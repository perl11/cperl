=head1 NAME

perlcdelta - what is new for cperl v5.25.1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes perl-only differences between the cperl 5.25.0
release and the cperl 5.25.1 development releases.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Security

=head2 C<@{ \327 \n }> buffer overflows

Fixed C<@{ \327 \n }> tokenizer failures and heap buffer overflows in
C<sv_vcatpvfn_flags()> with wrong tracking of C<PL_linestr>, the
currently parsed line buffer. This can easily lead to security
relevant exploits.

L<[perl #128951]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128951>

=head2 C<eval "q" . chr(overlarge)> stack overflow

In C<eval "q" . chr(100000000064)> generating the error message
C<Can't find string terminator "XXX"'> was overrunning a local buffer
designed to hold a single utf8 char, since it wasn't allowing for
the C<\0> at the end.

L<[perl #128952]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128952>

=head1 Performance Enhancements

=over 4

=item *

Extract C<hv_common_magical()> to a seperate function.  Extracts
uncommon magical code in hot code to an extra static function to help
keep the icache smaller. Only in rare cases this branch is
taken. I.e filling ENV at startup, or using tied hashes.

Measured 2-15% faster with normal scripts, not using tied hashes.

=item *

Use more C<strEQc>, C<strNEc> macros.

=item *

aassign: pre-allocate needed hash size with aassign, similar to
arrays, avoiding run-time hash splits.
e.g. C<my %h = (.. => .., .. => ..)>

This version is 30% faster overall in the Mail::SpamAssassin testsuite
than cperl-5.25.0.

=item *

Pre-extend internal hashes and stashes to avoid unnecessary boot-time hash
splits. C<%warnings::>, C<%Config::>, C<%utf8::>, C<%version::>.

=item *

Added new C<get_svs>, C<get_avs>, C<get_hvs> macros, and accompanied
C<get_[ash]vn_flags> API functions, to omit the run-time C<strlen(name)>
for constant names. (#191)

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>.  A paragraph summary
for important changes should then be added by hand.  In an ideal world,
dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be cribbed.

=item Win32

=over 4

=item *

Preserve the C<Systemroot> env var during env wipe for Win32 in F<t/op/magic.t>

This fixes a test fail with VC 2005 and VC 2008 on WinXP. The
C<Systemroot> env var is required on WinXP to load SXS tracked DLLs,
VC 2005 and 2008's MS libc's are SXS tracked (before and after are
not), so once %ENV is wiped and systemroot is deleted the C<require
Win32> cant load the XS DLL because the XS DLL is linked against the
SXS tracked libc specific to 2005/2008.

L<[perl #126041]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=126041>

=item *

Added strupr() and more ENV_IS_CASELESS helper functions for non-Win32/Netware
builds with ENV_IS_CASELESS being defined to easier test caseless windows ENV
handling on non-windows platforms.

=head1 Internal Changes

XXX Changes which affect the interface available to C<XS> code go here.  Other
significant internal changes for future core maintainers should be noted as
well.

=over 4

=item *

The maximal size of hashes has been reduced from 63 bit back to 32 bit
on 64-bit systems, as with perl5 upstream and as with cperl-5.22. The
only problem with 63 bit was the performance overhead of having to
calculate 64-bit hashes for each string, which was not worth it. For
overlarge hashes use tie to an external library which handle bigger
sizes and external maps.

This affects C<xhv_keys>, C<xhv_max>, C<xhv_riter>, C<xhv_fill_lazy>,
placeholders and the return values and arguments of most C<hv_>
functions and macros.  C<xhv_riter> is now a full C<U32>, thus the
previous tombstone value C<-1> is now C<U32_MAX>, so contrary to perl5
you can still iterate over the full keys range, and not just the half
of it.

=item *

C<PL_maxo> is now tracked/incremented in C<custom_op_register()>.

The static number of OPs is determined by the static C<MAXO>
definition, but users can add custom ops.

Note that perl5.25.4 removes the dynamic part C<maxo>.
We find it useful, as only C<maxo> returns the number of current ops.

=item *

HVhek_MASK is now only 0x03, sames as HVhek_ENABLEHVKFLAGS, which is
not needed anymore.

HVhek_MASK is only needed during hash collision comparisons.
There we only need the 2 UTF8 bits: HVhek_UTF8 and HVhek_WASUTF8,
but not the 3 others: UNSHARED, TAINTED, STATIC. (the 2 last being
cperl-only)

=back

=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

=over 4

=item *

Fix HEK_TAINTED check for HEf_SVKEY values. A HEf_SVKEY hek has no
tainted flag, the pointed to SV has. This is a cperl-only security
feature.

=item *

Only clear LS_COLORS for glob

When miniperl calls csh to implement glob(), we cleared %ENV
temporarily to avoid csh dying on invalid values for things like
LS_COLORS.  That has proven to have far too many problems, since many
system-dependent env vars are necessary for calling an external
process.  See the L<[perl #126041]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=126041> ticket for details.

A better solution is temporarily to clear only those vars that are
known to be problematic and make csh possibly fail.  There only hap-
pens to be one of those at present, namely LS_COLORS.

=item *

A SEGV in mess_sv during global destruction with a DEBUGGING perl and
-DS been fixed, occuring when we wanted to report the location of an
error when curcop has already been freed.

Testcase: C<./miniperl -DS -e '$_="f"; s/./"&".$&/ee'>

L<[perl #129027]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=129027>

=item *

A SEGV in ck_chift with an empty/wrong current function, caused by a
syntax error has been fixed. The syntax error is now reported lateron.
Testcase: C<'qq{@{sub{q}}]]}}; s0{shift'>

L<[perl #125351]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=125351>

=item *

Since Perl 5.20, line numbers have been off by one when perl is invoked with
the B<-x> switch.  This has been fixed.
L<[perl #128508]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128508>

=item *

Handle missing Unicode heredoc terminators correctly.
E.g. C<perl -CS -e 'use utf8; q«'>
prints now C<Can't find string terminator "«" anywhere before EOF at -e line 1.>

L<[perl #128701]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128701>

=item *

Mentioning a constant twice in a row does not lead to assertions
errors with DEBUGGING builds, such as e.g. C<sub ub(){0} ub ub>.

L<[perl #126482]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128701>

=item *

C< until ($x = 1) { ... } > and C< ... until $x = 1 > now properly
warn when syntax warnings are enabled.
L<[perl #127333]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=127333>

=item *

C<require> followed by a single colon (as in C<foo() ? require : ...> is
now parsed correctly as C<require> with implicit $_, rather than
C<require "">.
L<[perl #128307]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128307>

=item *

Code that looks for a variable name associated with an uninitialized value
could cause an assertion in cases where magic is involved, such as
C<$ISA[0][0]>.
L<[perl #128253]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128253>

=item *

In Perl 5.18, the parsing of C<"$foo::$bar"> was accidentally changed, such
that it would be treated as C<$foo."::".$bar>.  The previous behavior, which
was to parse it as C<$foo:: . $bar>, needs to be restored.
L<[perl #128478]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128478>

=item *

A crash caused by code generating the warning "Subroutine STASH::NAME
redefined" in cases such as C<sub P::f{} undef *P::; *P::f =sub{};> needs to be
fixed.  In these cases, where the STASH is missing, the warning should appear
as "Subroutine NAME redefined".
L<[perl #128257]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128257>

=item *

An assertion triggered by some code that handles deprecated behavior in
formats needs to be fixed, e.g. in cases like this:

    format STDOUT =
    @
    0"$x"

L<[perl #128255]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128255>

=item *

Some regular expression parsing glitches could lead to assertion failures with
regular expressions such as C</(?<=/> and C</(?<!/>.
L<[perl #128170]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128170>

=item *

Fixed a SEGV with C<cperl -Dsv -e'$_="q0" and s///ge'> in Perl_deb_stack_all()
L<[perl #129029]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=129029>

=head1 Known Problems

Most of these fixes still need to be backported from perl5.25.x upstream:

=over 4

=item *

F<t/op/taint.t> contained a test with signatures and 6 default
arguments, which on some 32 bit systems led to random "Reference
parameter cannot take default value at op/taint.t line 2461"
compile-time failures. This test has been rewritten to ony use 4 arguments.

See L<[cperl #164]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/164>

=item *

C<clang -flto=thin> and on some systems even C<gcc -flto> with C<-O3>
or C<-finline> leads to invisible symbols which were inlined and not
exported, even if they should be declared as public API. Work is
ongoing in the F<feature/gh186-lto-thin> branch, but there the
inlining is disabled by the C<used> attribute, leading to a
10% performance regression.  On the other hand a working
C<clang-3.9 -flto> leads to 20% performance improvements.

=item *

List assignment to C<vec> or C<substr> with an array or hash for its first
argument used to result in crashes or "Can't coerce" error messages at run
time, unlike scalar assignment, which would give an error at compile time.
List assignment now gives a compile-time error, too.
