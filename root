Perl 12 is essentially Perl 7 + Perl 5. This is probably exactly what the world calls for.\n* We can be `++Perl11`. To show that we no longer *just* base off Perl 5 and Perl 6. I use preincrement here so as not to confuse the great work done here with other inferior languages.\n\nAlso because Perl 6 isn't really Perl anymore perhaps this is the time to drop it. In which case Perl11 would just be Perl 7. But we don't want to stop on their toes, so I propose Perl 8.","files":null}]}
