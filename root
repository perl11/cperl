Or missing -I. (`-Dfortify_inc`). Or just bad cperl-unspecific tests, which happen to work on some systems, from the younger toolchain folks.\nSome tests still rely on some stable hash ordering, which is with cperl and it's new move-to-front strategy again different (Text::CSV_XS t/90_csv.t)\n\nNot yet patched:\n- autovivification (mderef rpeep changes)\n- TryCatch\n- Catalyst::Runtime\n- Time::Tiny, Date::Tiny, DateTime::Tiny (DateTime::locale broken since 5.22. unrelated to cperl, -f force install)\n\nUnneeded:\n- Devel::Cover - too version specific tests, works fine, just force install.\n\nDone:\n- Test::CleanNamespaces (padlist core SEGV, see #162)\n  and see the https://github.com/rurban/distroprefs/\n- Scope::Upper Done with #168 df515dd880cf0d7aa19f2bf206d9f3703e5ab4ac\n- XML::LibXML (libxml2-2.9.4 schema regression) https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=114638","files":null}]}
