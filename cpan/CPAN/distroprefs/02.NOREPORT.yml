  In general nobody wants to see reports about old developer releases
  of perl anymore. The disadvantage of this distroprefs file is that it
  prevents all the others from matching since only the first match
  wins.

  But then on 2009-01-14 my smoker sent this:
  http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2009/01/msg3068489.html
  which I cannot explain why. CPAN.pm was 1.9205, did it not implement
  the construct? CPAN::Reporter was 1.13. Cannot reproduce (but did
  not try very hard)

match:
  perlconfig:
    version: '^5\.(7|9|1[13579]|2[1357])\.'
cpanconfig:
  test_report: 0

  MSHELOR: would prefer to never see false positives which I cannot
  guarantee, so we turn off mails for him completely. Main involvement
  was Digest::SHA which got FAILs during a short phase of 5.9.3 due to
  some broken headerfiles in these bleadperls. A better solution than
  disabling reports would be configure stuff that probes for the
  signature of Newz (or was it Newx?)

  I had a good email exchange with Mark and so I rediscovered the
  cpanconfig/test_report distropref setting which I had already
  forgotten.

  BARBIE: opt out. Barbie does not want time-in-the-future errors
