=head1 NAME

perlcdelta - what is new for cperl v5.27.1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes the differences between the cperl 5.27.0
and the cperl 5.27.1 releases.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as v5.24.2c, first
read the L<perl525*cdelta> documentation, which describes differences
between v5.25.1c and v5.26.0c

=head1 Core Enhancements

=head2 class, role, method, has

cperl has now classes, roles, methods and fields.
Old user-subroutines or parser-hacks with these names are still
supported, but not recommended.
See L<perlclass>.

=head2 Check and normalize stringified names

Before symbols and identifiers created from strings at run-time were
added asis. Now those names are treated almost as in the parser at
compile-time, i.e. unicode is normalized, mixed Unicode scripts are
checked at run-time also. cperl-only.

Behaviour of L<perlapi/valid_ident>:

    ${"\xc3\x28"}       => FALSE.  Illegal unicode, but no warning or error,
                           unless under strict names.
    ${"E\x{45}\x{301}"} => TRUE.   Normalized to $E\x{c9}
    ${"एxṰர::ʦፖㄡsȨ"}   => FALSE. Error: Invalid script Tamil in identifier
                            ர::ʦፖㄡsȨ for U+0BB0. Have Devanagari

See below L</strict names>. C<use strict> fatalizes now any run-time
identifier parsing problem.

=head2 strict names

strict names is the default when using C<use strict>.  Reject illegal
identifiers at run-time when created dynamically from strings, which
would be rejected at compile-time. cperl-only.

    use strict "names";
    ${"\$var"}    => Invalid identifier "$var" while "strict names"
    ${"\xff"}     => Invalid identifier "\377" while "strict names"
    ${"\xc3\x28"} => Invalid identifier "\303(" while "strict names"

See L<perldata/"Identifier parsing"> and
L<http://perl11.org/blog/strict-names.html>

=head1 Deprecations

=head2 Module removals

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<"deprecated">-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

=over

=item L<B::Debug>

will be removed from core with 5.30, and needs to be installed from
CPAN then.  Best together with L<B::Flags>.

=head1 Performance Enhancements

=over 4

=item *

XS calls were made faster again. Previously cperl (with 5.22.1c) fell
from pure perl calls to XS calls and changed the call type to
ENTERXSSUB for faster subsequent invocations. This made bigger
examples ~10% faster.  Now the compiler detects calls to XS code and
changes the type to ENTERXSSUB.  Also the method cache code checks now
for an XS call and changes the type of the next OP. Overall the
improvement is ~3.5%, but it depends on the frequency of XS
calls. It's 0.5-1% slower without any XS call.  Note that p5p decided
to delete this feature request from it's TODO list.

The optree is a bit slimmer.
Before:

    $ cperl5.27.0d-nt -Dt -e'use strict'
    (-e:1)	nextstate
    (-e:1)	const(PV("strict.pm"))
    (-e:1)	require
    (-e:1)	nextstate
    (-e:1)	pushmark
    (-e:1)	const(PV("strict"))
    (-e:1)	method_named(->import)
    (-e:1)	entersub(strict::import)
    (-e:1)	enterxssub(strict::import)
    (-e:1)	leavesub

Now:

    $ cperl5.27.1d-nt -Dt -e'use strict'
    (-e:1)	nextstate
    (-e:1)	const(PV("strict.pm"))
    (-e:1)	require
    (-e:1)	nextstate
    (-e:1)	pushmark
    (-e:1)	const(PV("strict"))
    (-e:1)	method_named(->import)
    (-e:1)	enterxssub(strict::import)
    (-e:1)	leavesub

Note that this is still not optimal, as strict::import can be
compile-time optimized from a dynamic method call to a static function
call. A regression from 5.22.1c.
See L<http://blogs.perl.org/users/rurban/2011/06/how-perl-calls-subs-and-methods.html>

=item *

Most checks for readonly packages are now avoided, needed to bypass
the "Attempt to access disallowed key %s in the restricted hash
%CLASS::" errors. Stash lookup now got a B<GV_CLASS> flag and C<hv_fetch*_ifexists>
macros, which does the EXISTS and FETCH hash actions in the stash on one.

=item *

Optimized the loop op ITER to jump directly to the subsequent AND op.
For an empty body, this cuts about 20% off the time of an iteration.
Backported from perl-5.27.3. This is a simplier implementation of
the cperl F<feature/gh138-iter-and> branch from L<[cperl

=item L<attributes> 1.12c

Fixed :const parsing with SVs (cperl-only). Previously :const would set
the containing sub to :const, now it sets the lexical to readonly,
with deferring the attributes::import call after an assignment.

    my %h :const = (a => 1);
=>
    assign %h = (...);
    attributes->import(PACKAGE, \%h, const);

See L<[cperl #294]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/294>.

=item L<B> 1.68_08

Add non-destructive $cv->PUREGV method, which does not create a GV
from a CvNAMED $cv.
Warning: $cv->GV does create a GV from a CvNAMED $cv.

Internal Refactor: thread API

Add many missing methods and docs. Some from B::C.

=item L<B::C> 1.55_04

Protect from destructive $cv->GV, renamed is_lexsub to is_named,
allow @0, &0, ... types.

=item L<B::Debug> 1.25

Deprecated from CORE, will not be in 5.30 anymore.
Avoid destructive CvNAMED vivification to GVs.
Add cperl features.

=item L<base> 2.26c

Turn off HvCLASS again, just turn on SvREADONLY C<@ISA>.
With all the new class features, we cannot and should not compete.

The problem is the new sub as :method warning with classes, which
would cause all Test::Simple methods to be declared as :method, as they
derive from base.

=item L<Cpanel::JSON::XS> 3.0237

Stringify true again as "1".
Disallow duplicate keys by default, only allow them in relaxed mode.
De-fragilize t/96_mojo.t false test to "". It mostly is.
Fix and unify utf8 handling with 5.6.2 and improve many utf8 tests.
Add tests for boolean sv_yes and sv_no.
Check for correct module in %INC.
Relax inf/nan detection for newer msvcrt.dll runtime versions
(it's now almost ANSI).

=item L<Devel::Peek> 1.26_02

Add TYPECHECKED, RETTYPE and pad var names and types.

=item L<Devel::PPPort> 3.36_02

Restore silence under C<make -s>. I broke it in cperl 5.27.0

Add C<#if { CPERL && VERSION > 5.26.0 }> support,
support parser enum expectation.

=item L<deprecate>  0.03_01

Add pod synopsis for modules for older perls.

=item L<Encode> 2.92

Skip the flapping test F<t/Aliases.t> on threaded smokers, with random
segfaults.  This is a long standing core bug, with PMOP aliases or
clone. First observed at L<https://github.com/rurban/perl-compiler/issues/73>
(since 5.6)

Stop directory tweaking $Encode::Encoding{utf8}

Fix gcc warnings for older gcc < 4.0

Where possible do not depend on value of $@, instead use return value
of eval

Fix more XS problems in Encode.xs file

Load modules Encode::MIME::Name and Storable normally

Remove no warnings 'redefine'; and correctly loaddependences

Remove PP stubs and reformat predefine_encodings()

Run Encode XS BOOT code at compile time

Use Encode::define_encoding and propagate carp/croak message

cperl fixes: encoding undeprecated, no strict hashpairs

Cleanup code for handling fallback/replacement characters

=item L<ExtUtils::CBuilder> 0.280226

Fix C++ compiler detection (RT #131749)

=item L<ExtUtils::Install> 2.14

- Fix tests for when perl path contains a space

- Fix win32 check

- 'make -s' support: set $INSTALL_QUIET automatically

- Optimisations:

  * use our instead of vars
  * lazy load modules
  * make OS variables into constants
  * move some calculations out of a loop

- Removed instructions using Build.PL from README

- Load Win32API::File for _move_file_at_boot only when needed

- Allow disabling autosplit by omitting autosplit dir

=item L<ExtUtils::MakeMaker> 8.30_04

Merge our fixes to upstream 7.30 (which has e.g. the dlltool mingw
fixes). Many fixes were already in, but some new upstream bugs crept
in.

Support IO::Scalar handle as $parsefile argument to
ExtUtils::MM_Unix::parse_version().

fix Invalid Locale symbol name. Invalid identifier "ENCODING_UTF-8"
while "strict names"

fix XSMULTI static with strict linkers, avoid duplicate symbol
_boot_XS__Test in: Test.o blib/arch/auto/XS/Test/Test.a(Test.o)

xsstatic: fixup MAKE_APERL_FILE, which was Makefile.aperl.aperl

=item L<ExtUtils::ParseXS> 3.35_02

Moved xs pods still missing from the CPAN release completely to core.

Bump versions.

=item L<fields> 2.25c

A cperl class has now fields with C<@class::FIELDS> targ offsets to
the lexical fields, and the old C<%type::FIELDS> hash pointing to the
C<*class> GV, allowing again compile-time type checks on typed object
hash accesses.

=item L<File::Path> 3.15_01c

Remove erroneous documentation.
Correct skip count for Windows.
Comment out two TODO tests.
Make subdirectory names used in tests more random.

=item L<File::Spec::Functions> 3.36_05

Bumped version from unparsable 3.3.65, which prevented e.g.
File::chdir to install.

=item L<Filter::Simple> 0.94

Various small documentation fixes.
Swap out base.pm use for parent.pm.
Remove use of deprecated \C regex feature.
Filter::Simple was erroneously signalling eof if it encountered a
‘no MyFilter’ right after ‘use’:
      use MyFilter;
      no MyFilter;
In this case it should simply not filter anything.

=item L<Getopt::Long> 2.50

Fix bug L<https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=120231>.

Fix bug L<https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=120300>.
Unfortunately, this withdraws a small part of fix 114999.  GNU
C<getopt_long()> does not accept the (optional) argument to be passed
to the option without C<=> sign.  We do, since not doing so breaks
existing scripts.

Provide a default value for options (B<gnu_compat> mode).
Thanks to Andrew Gregory.

and "Can't modify non-lvalue method call of CLASS->sub".

=item *

Under DEBUGGING "Modification of a read-only value attempted at

=item mingw

cperl on mingw was previously unsupported and didn't compile nor work.

The plan is to use mingw 32bit and 64bit packages instead of MSVC
compiled packages, which do require a special MS runtime DLL.

=over

=item *

Removed the broken F<dlltool>, which corrupted 64bit DLL's for years.
In our case Cpanel::JSON::XS and Unicode::Normalize.
Just use C<gcc> to create dll's and import libs, as in cygwin.

=item *

Added version specific gcc config values.

The default mingw configs were extremely defensive and slow.  Even
gcc-2.95.3 settings were disabled. Now several modern builtins and
attributes are used.

Fixed the wrong C<d_u32align> default, which caused Digest::MD5 to
crash.

=item *

Fixed BUILTIN_*_OVERFLOW macros for mingw64, which uses long long for
normal IV/UV on win64.

=item *

Removed the version suffix from the importlib which is the entry for
C<$Config{libperl}>. C<-lcperl> works now for the compiler and embedders.
Just keep the version on MSVC, e.g. F<cperl527.lib>, as this had special
logic in perlcc already.

=item *

Improved F<t/run/switchDBG.t> for C<-D''> and C<-T> tests.

=item *

Fixed building of the extensions with the Extensions_normalize target.

=item *

Switched from F<C:\MinGW> to F<C:\Strawberry\c> as default B<CCHOME> prefix.
This is much more stable on 64bit, and easier to setup.

=item *

The compiler F<perlcc> only works with very simple programs under mingw yet.
With dynaloaded XS modules it usually fails.

=item *

Many gv_fetch methods use now GV_CLASS, i.e. they try EXISTS and FETCH
in the same stash lookup, not failing on restricted stashes.

=item *

The overload magic vtable (AMT) allows now readonly stashes. classes
are not cached, readonly packages are.

=back

=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

=item *

Fixed signature corruption with skip'ed arguments without default and
with 0, 1, undef or op defaults, such as in C<sub func ($, $=0, $=1,
$=2, $=do{$i++} $="foo", $a="bar", $b="zoot")>, with the first C<$>,
the 2nd C<$=0>, the 3rd C<$=1> and the 5th C<$=do{}> argument.
cperl-only.

=item *

Harmonized TOKENBUF_SIZE and stack buf sizes

The max identifier length depends on the max tokenbuf size, which went
from 256 in perl5 to 1024 in cperl, mostly to speed up parsing with a
larger parser buffer. A few places still had hardcoded 256 tmpbuf sizes, which
led to wrong error messages.
See L<[cperl #293]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/293>.

=item *

Fixed one place in ck_sort for utf8 lexical variable names, which
passed the unneeded UTF8 flag to C<pad_findmy_pvn()>. In cperl all pads
are normalized UTF8 for faster searches, the flag argument must be 0.
See L<[cperl #293]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/293>.

=item *

Fix regex stack recursion overflow with DEBUGGING

This is a regression since 5.26 (also in upstream perl5). Without
DEBUGGING it failed with the error message "Unmatched ( in regex", now
with more than 5000 open parens it will fail with the same error message.
This would be security relevant if one would use a DEBUGGING perl in
production as one can construct a pattern which writes arbitrary
values to the stack, similar to the Storable (L<[cperl
#257]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/257>, L<[cpan
#97526]|https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=97526>) stack
overflow and the old 5.10 regex stack overflow attack.  See L<[cperl
#293]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/293>.

=item *

Fixed wrong "Don’t stringify GV in numeric cx outside warnings scope"
optimization from 5.18, which fails with code like C<$* += (** = 0)>.
See L<[cperl #299]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/299>.

=item *

Added missing arity checks to C<readline> and C<readpipe>.
E.g. C<readline(1,2)> and C<readpipe(1,2)> errors now.  Those
excessive args were previously called for side-effects, in case of
constants or variables effectively ignored.

All internal ops are now properly arity checked.
See L<[cperl #301]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/301>.

=item *

More fixes for handling readonly packages, aka classes.
Allow AMT (overload) cache updates, C<@ISA> searches and general class dispatch,
falling back to AUTOLOAD in classes.

E.g. this works now: C<<< class XX{method m{"ok $self"}} XX->new->m >>>
The string concat looked in the class XX for an overload for the concat "." op,
and failed with "Modification of a read-only value attempted" on the class,
when trying to update the AMT cache.
On windows it also tried the C<"(qr"> overload.
See L<[cperl #308]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/308>.

=item *

Attempting to apply an attribute to an C<our> variable where a
function of that name already exists could result in a NULL pointer
being supplied where an SV was expected, crashing perl.
