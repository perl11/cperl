YES, NO","message":"The parser keeps SV_YES, SV_NO and friends in arrays asis. But when converting at runtime into a list, via av_make sv_setsv the SV_YES is lost and turned into a PVNV of 1\n\nSpecial case sv_setsv_flags for the immortals, which also makes it faster for these. They don't need to be copied, they are immortal after all.\n\nSee https://github.com/rurban/Cpanel-JSON-XS/issues/161\n\nThis is esp. useful for XS roundtrips, treating booleans as such.","files":null}]}
