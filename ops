It tries to avoid the overflow checks at all, earlier.\nThe 4 commits starting with 20e9643135b0912e2449f038a0ec1c0e84657f3f\n- 20e9643 split pp_postdec() from pp_postinc() and improve\n- 4c2c312 split pp_predec() from pp_preinc() and improve\n- 230ee21 faster add, subtract, multiply\n- edba15b make SETi/u/n, (X)PUSHi/u/n more efficient\n\nNeed to benchmark that if it's not actually slower than fast overflows at all. It adds a lot of branch code before that. If it's slower use that only with older C compilers without HAS_BUILTIN_ARITH_OVERFLOW\n\nThe old fastarith branch from February started here: 8b6139a5cbb3307067daf51503fdee2771595afb","files":null}]}
